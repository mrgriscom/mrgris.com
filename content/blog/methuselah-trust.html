can't find guaranteed return above inflation
can't find any bank that will guarantee a return for 1,000 years, let alone one above inflation.

as capital grows, over-supply of money for borrowing; demand falls, and thus interest rates. low interest rates spur borrowing, economic growth, and inflation.

only by the foresight of man is such a situation impossible.

compound interest rates are not some inaliable property of the universe. trying to apply micro thinking to a macro situation.

clearly it would have an _effect_ on the global economy, but it would not destroy it... images of every person on earth toiling every hour to satisfy the trust's returns.

actually poses some interesting questions on how it would actually all pay out. would the trust stablize at a certain % of global economic output (a 'methuselah constant'?)

or would it never really grow that large at all? can a trust actually grow big only through investment vehicles? higher-than-inflation investments have some amount of risk, and over a thousand-year timespan, seems like enough time for the risky failures to occur.
