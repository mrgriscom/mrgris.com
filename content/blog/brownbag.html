This talk delves into power-usage of `ssh` and `screen`.

# SSH

## Local port forwarding

    ssh user@remoteserver -L localport:targetserver:targetport

Any network traffic hitting `localport` on the local machine (the machine you're ssh'ing _from_) will be forwarded over the encrypted `ssh` channel to `remoteserver` (the machine you're ssh'ing _to_), *and then onward* to `targetport` on `targetserver`.

The traffic coming into the local machine, and going from `remoteserver` to `targetserver` is **unencrypted**.
Only the segment between the local machine and `remoteserver` is encrypted.
Usually the tunneled traffic originates from your local machine and `targetserver` is the same as `remoteserver`, so in practice the entire communication would be secure.

`targetserver` is resolved relative to `remoteserver`.
That means `targetserver` could be an internal IP on `remoteserver`'s LAN that you could not access directly from the local machine.
This is also what lets you specify "`localhost`" as `targetserver`, since it's "`localhost`" as resolved with respect to `remoteserver`.

Local forwards are useful for the following scenarios:

- access a service on a remote machine that is only available locally (either because only local connections are allowed, or the port is blocked via firewall)

      ssh remoteserver -L 4000:localhost:5984

  > access couchdb running on a remote server; we can now access it using the address `localhost:4000`
  {: .example}

- access a firewalled/NAT'ted machine that you cannot access directly

      ssh remoteserver -L 8080:192.168.1.15:80

  > `192.168.1.15` is only visible on `remoteserver`'s LAN.
    We access its webserver via `localhost:8080`; traffic is forwarded through `remoteserver`
  {: .example}

- encrypting a channel that would otherwise be unencrypted

      ssh remoteserver -L 5900:localhost:5900

  > `vnc` is an insecure protocol; passwords are sent in the clear and desktop contents are visible to anyone snooping the traffic.
    Instead of vnc'ing to `remoteserver`, we securely `vnc` to `localhost`
  {: .example}

- masking the origin of traffic

      ssh stoogeserver -L 8080:dupedserver:80

  > Forwarding a connection in this manner is not always transparent.
    For example, HTTP includes a `Host` parameter that specifies the hostname the browser wants to connect to.
    In this case that will be `stoogeserver:8080` and `dupedserver` will see that.
  {: .example}

By default, only local traffic can connect to `localport`.
To enable external hosts to use the port forward through your machine, invoke as `ssh remoteserver -L `**`*:`**`localport:targetserver:targetport` (note asterisk).

## Remote port forwarding

    ssh user@remoteserver -R remoteport:targetserver:targetport

Any network traffic hitting `remoteport` on `remoteserver` will go to your local machine (via encrypted channel), and then onward to `targetport` on `targetserver` from the local machine.
`targetserver` is now resolved relative to the local machine, but in the remote forwarding scenario `targetserver` is nearly always "`localhost`".

Useful for:

- making a public server (visible to the internet at large) that forwards to your local machine

      ssh publicserver -R 8053:localhost:8053

  > You're testing an android app over GPRS against your dev server.
    The app can only hit public IPs.
    Now it can access your dev server via `publicserver:8053`
  {: .example}

There is a catch with remote forwards.
For the above scenario (which is really the only useful scenario) to work, external traffic must be allowed to connect to `remoteport`.
This is only allowed if the `GatewayPorts` setting in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` is `yes`.
This is not the case by default on most installs.
Therefore, you **must have root** on `remoteserver` to enable this.
The setting is in the config of the `ssh` *server*, so no client settings you do can override it.

As for the "`*:`" to enable external connections, it seems usually implicit for remote forwards.
But... sometimes not; I don't understand the circumstances when it is necessary vs. not -- when in doubt, add it; it can't hurt anything.
It **will not** override `GatewayPorts`.

If you can't change `sshd_congig`, there is a workaround.
We can daisy-chain a local forward to the remote forward, so all traffic hitting `remoteport` originates from `remoteserver` itself:

1. `ssh remoteserver -R dummyport:localhost:targetport`
1. then, on `remoteserver`, `ssh localhost -L *:remoteport:localhost:dummyport` (note the '*')

Needless to say, this is ridiculous.

## Running a command remotely (in lieu of a shell)

    ssh user@server command

> e.g., `ssh user@server ls -l ~`
{: .example}

## Escape character

`~` typed after a newline is the `ssh` escape character.
It allows you to perform out-of-band actions with the `ssh` session.
Some highlights:

- `~?` -- print list of available commands
- `~.` -- terminate the session (useful if network dropped or session is hung)
- `~[ctrl-z]` -- suspend session (instead of suspending the currently running program *inside* the session)
- `~C` -- enter command line to add additional port forwards on-the-fly (type `help`)
- `~~` -- type a literal `~`

## Connection multiplexing
{: style="margin-top: 40px;"}

Additional `ssh` sessions can piggyback on an originating session's connection.
No authentication is needed for the piggybacking sessions (and as a side-benefit the connection will establish very quickly).

To start the first session (the "master session"):

    ssh -M -S /tmp/sshsocket user@server

For piggybacking sessions:

    ssh -S /tmp/sshsocket user@server

This is particularly useful when the piggybacking sessions run a command on the remote server instead of a shell.

I use connection multiplexing to control my media server.
I'll open the media player on the server and have the UI running locally (see next section).
This is the master connection.
Then I set keybindings to run control commands (volume up/down, prev/next track, etc.) as piggybacking sessions.
Each keypress/command runs in a new, short-lived piggybacking session -- now you can see why quick connection time is so important.

`/tmp/sshsocket` can be any file, unique to the master session.
*Any user/process with access to this file can piggyback on the session*.
You can also use shorthand like `/tmp/ssh-%r@%h:%p`, which `ssh` will auto-expand to help maintain uniqueness among master sessions.

## X forwarding

Run GUI programs on a remote server!

    ssh -X user@server callofduty

## Obscure options

Any configuration option available in `ssh_config` can be invoked on a per-session basis.
This is **very** useful when running `ssh` from scripts:

- `ssh -o BatchMode=yes` -- fail immediately if any interactive prompt is displayed (e.g., password prompt), since these would hang your script forever
- `ssh -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes` -- abort if the desired port forwards could not be set up
- `ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60` -- 'ping' the server every 60 seconds and terminate the session if some consecutive number of pings go unanswered (usually 3)

The combination of these three options can ensure robust `ssh` tunneling from non-interactive scripts.

## Quickly set up key-based auth

    ssh-copy-id user@server

> copies your public keys to the remote server
{: .example}

## File transfers

Everyone knows `scp`.
Quick and dirty, but not robust.
There are better options.

- **sftp**

  Usually the easiest bet for quick and dirty, with the added benefit of a GUI.
  Your file manager probably has support built-in, otherwise, you need a dedicated client.

- **Remote filesystem**

      sshfs user@server:path localpath

  > mount `path` on the remote server as a filesystem under `localpath`.
    You have to create `localpath` yourself, sadly.
    Useful for both command-line and GUI browsing, *without* need for any special client support.
    **Not robust** against dropped connections. Unmount with `fusermount -u localpath`
  {: .example}

- **rsync**

  `rsync` is fantastic tool, and can use `ssh` as a transport layer.

      rsync -ravz -e ssh user@server:path localpath

  > (note that `user@server:path` is interpreted according to `rsync` semantics, not `ssh`!)
  {: .example}

  To robustly transfer a 10GB database file from Africa while you sleep:

      while [ true ] ; do rsync -ravz --progress --partial -e ssh user@server:path localpath ; sleep 5 ; done

  - the loop will resume after dropped connections
  - `--partial` allows resuming the transfer
  - `--progress` displays a progress bar
  - `sleep 5` avoids flooding the server.

  Make sure you're set up to log into `user@server` using password-less authentication, otherwise resume attempts will hang with a password prompt!

  You may want to use a one-off keypair for the transfer. 
  Specify an arbitrary private key to use (don't forget to set up the corresponding public key on the remote server) by replacing `-e ssh` with `-e "ssh -i /path/to/privatekey.key"`.

## There's a long delay when logging in...

This is usually either:

- the `ssh` server is trying to reverse DNS lookup the client IP, and it has to wait for the lookup to time out

  Fix with `UseDNS no` in `sshd_config`

- the `ssh` server is trying to integrate with an authentication library that is not configured properly, and timing out

  Fix by disabling the guilty library in `sshd_config`, i.e., `GSSAPIAuthentication no` or `UsePAM no`

# SCREEN

## Basics

I'm sure you all know these:

- `C-a c` -- new window
- `C-a [#]`, `C-a p`, `C-a n` -- change windows
- `C-a k` -- kill window
- `C-a d` -- detach from session
- `screen -ls` -- display sessions
- `screen -r` -- resume session

## How the f#$% do I scroll
{: style="margin-top: 40px;"}

Enter 'copy' mode: `C-a [`.
In copy mode, you can navigate around the history using arrows and page up/down.

The size of the buffer is pretty limited by default.
To make it bigger, do any of:

- `screen -h ####` (affects all windows in this session)
- `C-a :scrollback ####` (affects current window only)
- set a bigger default in your `.screenrc`

In 'copy' mode, you can also search with `C-a s` (forward) or `C-r` (backward).

Copy text using mark and set points.
`space` to start/end at the current char; `y` to start/end at the current line.

To paste:

- `C-a ]` -- paste into current window
- `C-a &gt;` -- dump copy buffer to file

or:

- `C-a h` -- write current window (visible portion only) to file
- `C-a :hardcopy -h /must/specify/a/file` -- write the entire scrollback history to `file`
- `C-a H` -- start/stop logging of current terminal to file

## Monitoring a window for activity
{: style="margin-top: 40px;"}

- `C-a M` -- alert if this window has activity
- `C-a _` -- alert if this window has no activity for a while

## Split-screen
{: style="margin-top: 40px;"}

- `C-a S` -- split current region horizontally
- `C-a |` -- split current region vertically
- `C-a [tab]` -- move to next region
- `C-a X` -- close this region
- `C-a Q` -- close all regions except this one

## Screen-sharing
{: style="margin-top: 40px;"}

    screen -x [session name]

  > allows multiple terminals to connect to the same session (must be same user)
  {: .example}

You can actually set up multi-user screen sharing, but it's kind of a bitch, and not that useful, for all of:

- the screen exe must be setuid root, along with other permissions changes
- no one can sudo; they must be running as their logged-in user
- there's a shitload of setup commands you have to run
- you can't really guarantee everyone is seeing the same thing; split-screens, window changes, etc., are all local to each connection
- a user closing a window or the session closes it for everybody

Oh well...

# NETCAT

Communicate with network sockets using stdin/stdout:

    nc host port

> connect to a server
{: .example}

    nc -l port

> listen and accept a single connection from a client (does not create a server; only good for one connection)
{: .example}

Once the connection is open, communicate with it by typing/piping.
