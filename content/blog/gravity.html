$$E=mgh$$

##100 lb## raised ##6 ft## at earth's gravity of ##9.81 m/s^2## gives a stored energy of ##813 J##.
Top-of-the-line LEDs can now produce about ##95 lm/W##, yielding a total lighting energy of ~##77000 lm*s##.
This could deliver the brightness of a single 60W incandescent bulb (~##850 lm##) for a whopping ##91## seconds.
If we dialed the brightness down to more like a small flashlight (~##70 lm##), our stored energy would stretch to ##18## minutes (assuming ##100%## efficiency).
Not quite a Hanukkah miracle.

The specs actually say a weight of only ##20 lb## and that it shines for a full half-hour.
This forces a brightness of only ##9## lumens -- about one candle's worth.


I'm really sick of hearing about this idea.
At least this one doesn't make the same mistake of suggesting it should be human powered, but the energy density of gravity is ridiculously low compared to practically any other technology we have.
It works for hydroelectric plants because they have _huge_ reservoirs to supply them.

Assume one of these gravity batteries uses a ##100 m## deep shaft with a counterweight the mass of a Cadillac Escalade. The energy stored is ##100 m## &times; ##2700 kg## &times; ##9.8 m/s^2## = ##2.6 MJ## (##0.7 kWh##).
The first deep-cycle battery I found through ten seconds of googling (retail price $260) has a capacity of ##90 Ah##. ##90 Ah## &times; ##12 V## and assume an ##80%## discharge cycle = ##3.1 MJ##.
It just doesn't add up!

Now I can't personally speak to the logistics of building a shaft taller than most elevators, hoisting a weight heavier than most elevators, oh and btdubs did I mention this shaft is going _into the ground_ where you have to deal with water seepage, corrosion, temperature gradients..., but I'm sure it costs a hell of a lot more than $260.
Gravity energy storage only makes sense when your reaction mass is on the order of cubic _miles_.

Here's another way to think about it: if gravity had a comparable energy density to chemical energy, you'd metabolize half your body mass simply climbing up a hill.
