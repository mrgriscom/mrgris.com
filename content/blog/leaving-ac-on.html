title: Annoying Thought Experiments: Leaving the AC on during the day
---

is it more efficient to leave the AC on during the day or turn it off when you leave and turn it on when you get back home.

strangely, no one ever argues for the reverse -- leave the heat on all day instead of turning it on only when you need it.

imagine the room/house is a bucket. the level of water in the bucket is how cold it is. empty means it's at ambient tempurature. the AC does work by pouring water into the bucket, making it colder. the AC has a maximum rate it can pour water into the bucket at (working as hard as it can). the bucket has a hole in it, which represents loss to the outside (or outside heat seeping in). a smaller hole corresponds to better insulation. note that the rate of leakage **also** correlates with the water level of the bucket. if it's more full, the water pressure at the bottom is higher, and water leaks out faster (i.e., you will have more AC lossage on a hotter day). at a certain point, the water will be leaking out at the same rate it's being poured in; this is the coldest that the AC can make the room. with better insulation, leakage will be lower, this level will be higher, and the room will get colder.

what's better, keep filling the bucket all day, or let it drain and fill it up only from the point needed?

there is NO point at which it's better to keep it on than recover from a later point, even if the room doesn't completely rise to ambient temperature in the interim.

de-humidification?
does cooling humid air take more energy?
does dehumidified air become rehumidified as it heats back up? don't think so-- heat can conduct through impermeable surfaces, whereas the water vapor must come from somewhere.
does 'keeping the room cold', which implies also defeating any incremental rehumidification.

efficiency gains based on temperature differential? don't think this matters, even if it's true. AC coils run colder than the air temperature they're set at.

efficiency gains based on running time? ACs work in short spurts. how long does it take to 'warm up' anyway?
