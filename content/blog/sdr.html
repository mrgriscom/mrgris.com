I recently bought a Software Defined Radio for... reasons... and holy shit this thing has completely blown my mind. What is a software defined radio, you ask? Well, a traditional radio (where 'radio' means any wireless communication device) tunes to a specific frequency and has lots of purpose-built circuits to process and interpret the signal. A software-defined radio, on the other hand, captures the raw radio wave and sends it to a computer, which can replace all that specialized processing with software (oversimplifying a lot). As a result, a single hardware device can replicate many different kinds of radios, or even experiment with new ones, and provide access to the signals at a level normally hidden from view.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/setup.jpg" width="740" class="glightbox" />

We know these radio waves are all around us at all times, but to actually be able to *see* and play with them... it's a very strange feeling-- an escaping-the-matrix, pulling back on the veils of existence kind of vibe.

In the short time I've had this thing, I've listened in on AM/FM radio, marine band, air traffic control, walkie-talkie channels, a shortwave station in China, aircraft navigational beacons...

And while audio transmissions are cool and all, the real ðŸ¤¯ stuff starts when decoding data transmissions out of thin air. Wireless data seems so crisp and clean, but an SDR exposes all the squishy analog reality beneath. So far I've achieved real-time tracking of ship and plane transponders, eavesdropped on the key fobs for my apartment building and car, sniffed cellular traffic, decoded our Burning Man DIY GPS tracker beacons, and even received a downlink from an orbiting weather satellite. All from a $20 USB dongle and simple rabbit ears antenna.

Sorry not your normal facebook content; just had to share my enthusiasm. It's incredibly addictive. You keep chasing ever more new signals to intercept. Hit me up if you want to go signal hunting.

FM
--

Listening to FM radio. The SDR sampling is precise enough that we're receiving 8 other adjacent stations simultaneously. Listening to these other stations requires only changing a software parameter, not actually re-tuning the receiver.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/fm.png" width="740" />

Walkie-talkies
--------------

Lots of chatter on walkie-talkie frequencies. Unlike a typical scanner, dozens of channels can be captured simultaneously. (As an aside, most of these people sounded very agitated... harried dock workers?)

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/frs.png" width="740" />

AM
--

Capturing the AM band.
Cape Town's 3 AM stations clearly visible.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/am.png" width="740" />

AM band much more alive in the US, with a station visible (thought not necessarily listenable) at every 10 kHz interval.
The horizontal light blue lines are broad-spectrum interference from lightning in the area.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/amus.png" width="740" />

You can see how much the signal is swamped mid-lightning strike.
It's around this time I decided it'd be prudent to reel in my antenna and call it a night.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/am-lightning.gif" width="740" />

Digital Radio
-------------

HD radio

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/hdradio-fft.png" />
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/hdradio-console.png" width="740" />

DAB

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/dab.png" width="740" />

AirNav beacons
--------------

Triangulating my position using the CPT airport and Robben Island VOR airnav beacons. Listening to these beacons directly, you will hear their callsign in morse code. But they also transmit a sub-signal that can derive your current bearing to the beacon.

<!-- TODO fuzz the location -->
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/vor.png" width="740" />

A simpler NDB (non-direction beacon) that only broadcasts its callsign (BSW âˆ’â€¢â€¢â€¢ â€¢â€¢â€¢ â€¢âˆ’âˆ’)

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/ndb.png" />


Ship-tracking
-------------

Live tracking of ships in Cape Town harbor using their AIS transponders.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/ais.png" width="740" />

Plane-tracking
--------------

Live tracking of airplanes using their ADS-B transponders on 1090 Mhz.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/flights1.png" width="740" />
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/flights2.png" width="740" />

LoRa IoT and our DIY Burning Man trackers
-----------------------------------------

Decoding the location pings from our [DIY GPS trackers](http://doorinthewall.co.za/blog/lora-gps-trackers/), using LoRa internet-of-things protocol. LoRa is proprietary, but like all good things in software, some enterprising hacker has reverse-engineered it.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/lora.png" width="740" />

Gate remotes
------------

Intercepting the codes transmitted by our gate opener. The varied codes on subsequent button presses shows this is a more secure "rolling code" system.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/gateremote.png" width="740" />

Cellular networks
-----------------

Sniffing serial #s of phones attempting to connect to a local cell tower over 2G.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/imsi.png" width="740" />

Weather satellites
------------------

Signal lock for NOAA 15 weather satellite passing overhead.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/noaafft.png" />

Decoded transmission from orbiting weather satellite. Visible clouds (land indistinct because pass was at night). Pretty rough, but not bad for a first try and did I mention this is a minutes-old picture of Earth directly from SPACE.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/noaa15.jpg" width="740" />

...and reference weather map of the same instant for comparison

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/weather-ref.jpg" width="740" />

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/noaa-sunset.png" width="740" />

setup shot?

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/apt-best.png" width="740" />

This is a legacy protocol from the 60s.
New satellites no longer contain this capability, only 3 are left and one is already developing camera problems.
This might not be around for much longer.

And check out the doppler shift if we time-lapse the whole pass.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/doppler.png" />

At an orbital velocity of 7400 m/s, which is 0.0025% of the speed of light, we'd expect a doppler shift of 3400 Hz on our carrier frequency 137.1 MHz. Double that for the satellite moving towards us then away from us -- 6.8 kHz total, which [pretty closely matches](https://xkcd.com/54/) the ~6 kHZ shift we see above.

Here's a more modern transmission from the Russian Meteor M2-2 satellite.
Uses digital encoding so better quality and error correction.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/meteor_demod.png" />

The four well-defined clusters (known as a [QAM constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation#Digital_QAM)) means a clean digital signal.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew/sdr/meteor-m2-2.png" />

False color.
Red channel is thermal infrared -- you can see the [Agulhas current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agulhas_Current) peeling off the east shore of South Africa.

The image is squashed left-to-right due to the perspective of the satellite's view from low-earth orbit (think like pressing your eye against a basketball).

Literally the day after I captured this the satellite was [hit by a micrometeor](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roscosmos.ru%2F27891%2F) and will likely be retired, leaving only Meteor M2 that broadcasts this particular digital mode.
Even that one occasionally loses orientation and points sideways, returning pictures [like this](https://i.redd.it/cp3vjqrty8w01.jpg).
Space is hard.

Going beyond here for real-time Earth imagery generally requires large dishes and/or tracking mounts.
Ain't nobody got time for that.


Shortwave oddities

Analog TV
---------

wanted to capture analog tv, but off air
but wait, cable is essentially a private broadcast antenna

[digital cable pedestal? -- if i have the right catv raw file]

digital cable though - need a vcr or converter box

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/tvsharp.png">
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/vcr.jpg" width="740">

not enough bandwidth for color/audio/fine detail.
but with rsp1a

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/ntsc-wf.png">

First hump is the main black&white signal, 2nd hump is the color information, and spike at the end is the audio channel.

decode to frames

<a class="glightbox video-thumbnail" href="http://drew/sdr/ntsc-cc.mp4"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/ntsc-cc.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/ntscinfo.png" width="740">

how faithfully can we recreate those analog artifacts? [[reference image](http://drew/sdr/colorbars_ref.png)]

(slowed down 4x -- [full speed here](http://drew/sdr/colorbars.mp4))

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/colorbars_slow.gif">

that dot crawl! ringing artifacts! that color bleed!

what can we actually do though? in theory receive scrambled channels, but those are long gone. can do next best thing, which is recreate ourselves

at last, realizing the dream of 90s teenager, control over the cable scrambling

requires transmit capability

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/txsetup.jpg" width="740">

As someone who has a bit of a "thing" for connectors and adapters, this 7-degree daisy chain (USB &rarr; VGA &rarr; BNC &rarr; SMA &rarr; 20dB attenuator &rarr; Type F connector &rarr; TV coaxial) was _extreeeeemely_ satisfying.

oh and it also works on some flat panel tvs too!?

<a href="http://drew/sdr/scramble_poc_orig.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/scramble_poc_orig.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

we can have other fun like injecting our own text into the closed captioning stream

<a href="http://drew/sdr/thanks.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/thanks.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

who knew closed captions supported colors?
certainly not i.
but it was in the [spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-608), and if you send the right control sequences, it works!

and after all that, turns out analog tv still being broadcast in south africa.
i just didn't realize what i was looking at

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/pal-ota-wf.png">
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/sabc.png">

That bright line in the vertical blanking interval gave some tantalizing hope of some sort of data to decode, possibly even a [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) feed.
But alas, it's just some kind of signal quality marker.
But apparently Teletext was active in South Africa, albeit in a somewhat moribund state, [as late as 2015](https://medium.com/@carinbevan/let-me-teledata-that-for-you-9a5a19cb01c4)!?
I think I would have felt like winning the lottery if I had found an active Teletext system still running in 2019.

Digital TV

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/hdtv-ant.jpg" width="740" />

decent reception with the rabbit ears antenna, but not consistent enough across the full bandwidth allocation to successfully decode.
apparently sticking a [wire into a potato](https://blog.solidsignal.com/tutorials/hd-blade-vs-potato-can-spud-bring-goods/) works fairly well.

That said, the [video for _I'm Turn't_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiUdrIsqmyQ) is pretty great

SSTV from the ISS

SSTV means "slow-scan television" but it's kind of a misnomer as it actually transmits still images (i.e., really slow).
ISS does this several times a year as outreach for HAM radio, usually commemorating a famous astronaut that has recently passed away.
kinda thought this was veering too much into HAM geekery for my tastes, but holy shit once that signal comes through it's pretty primal.
basically, expecting [this](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.qrz.com/x/i0jx/jxyoung.jpg), but actually [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCkbekhUdw4&t=16s)

Remote control and reverse engineering
--------------------------------------

<!-- trim and crop these videos -->

I wanted to cross over into actual radio hacking by reverse engineering an unknown protocol observed over the airwaves.
Wanted it to be manageable so simple simple with a RC remote, that also didn't overlap with established chipsets in the 433 MHz range.
I had access to one of the dog training collars proliferating on Amazon so seemed like a worthwhile target.

First gotta find the frequency.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/rc/freq.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/rc/freq.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Didn't expect it to be so low.
This turns out to be CB radio channel 19A, "reserved for remote control of devices such as model aircraft, cars, and boats"

Beware of harmonics.

Here's the demodulated waveform.

<!-- annotate these? -->

And fully decoded.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/rc/decode.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/rc/decode.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

With the FL2k transmitter, we can even do a replay attack.
This doesn't even require knowing how to decode the transmission.

IR remotes
----------

Almost all remote controls communicate via pulsed infrared light, modulated between 30-56 kHz.
An IR photodiode acts as an 'antenna' that can receive this IR light.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew/sdr/irdiode.jpg" />

IR light hitting the diode produces minute amounts of electricity, akin to the voltage induced in a metal antenna from radio waves.
Although IR light is itself electromagnetic radiation (with a frequency of ~300 THz), it's best to think of it here as an alternate 'medium' through which the lower-frequency signal propgates.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/irrecv.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/irrecv.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Note the signal centered on the 38 kHz carrier frequency, by far the most common.
Also note how the IR pulses register on the camera sensor, although invisible to the human eye.

Applying AM demodulation reveals the underlying data signal.

TEMPEST attacks
---------------

Reading a screen remotely via its stray radio emissions.

First step is to identify the frequency of the emissions. Need to make the monitor "sing".

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/furelise.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/furelise.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Though I prefer to sing to a different tune.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/darude.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/darude.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

So we've found the frequency; can we actually read the screen?

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/app.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/app.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

It works! It even works from across the room (and very faintly in the neighboring room).

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/across-room.mp4" class="glightbox"><video width="600" controls autoplay loop muted><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/across-room.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

It is extremely tempermental, though.
High-contrast imagery and hard transitions work best.
But even then, tiny -- almost imperceptible -- changes to the screen can completely break the effect.
How the image carries over to the eavesdropping session is not intuitive and seems to rely on internal workings of the monitor.

With perfect antenna placement and still a healthy dose of luck, I got what you see below.
Oftentimes, though, a real-world desktop barely registers as more than a smudge.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/desktop.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/desktop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

A higher-specced SDR (at least 10 MHz bandwidth or ideally 30, vs. the RTL-SDR's 3) would work better, but hey, I'm amazed this works at all.
