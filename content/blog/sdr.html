I recently bought a Software Defined Radio for... [reasons...](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19864189){:target="_blank"} and holy shit this thing has completely blown my mind.
What is a software defined radio, you ask?
Well, a traditional radio (where 'radio' is taken to mean any wireless communication device) tunes to a specific frequency and has lots of purpose-built circuits to process and interpret the signal.
A software-defined radio, on the other hand, captures the raw radio wave and sends it to a computer, which can replace all that specialized processing with software (oversimplifying a lot).
As a result, a single hardware device can replicate many different kinds of radios, or even experiment with new ones, and provide access to the signals at a level normally hidden from view.

We know these radio waves are all around us at all times, but to actually be able to *see* and play with them... it's a very strange feeling-- a kind of escaping-the-matrix, pulling back on the veils of existence experience.

Within minutes of unboxing you can listen to all kinds of radio chatter: FM radio, walkie-talkies, marine band, air band, weather band...
And while audio transmissions are cool and all, the real ðŸ¤¯ stuff starts when decoding data transmissions out of thin air.
Wireless data seems so crisp and clean, but an SDR exposes all the squishy analog reality beneath.

It's incredibly addictive.
You keep chasing ever more new signals to intercept and decode.
This post is a catalog of my various SDR trophies.
And all from a [$20 USB dongle](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/){:target="_blank"} and basic rabbit ears antenna.

The delightfully minimal setup below. Most of the exploits in the post used nothing more than this:

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/setup.jpg" width="740" class="glightbox" />

Broadcast FM
--

This is the obvious first stop for testing out a radio.
These signals are strong, ubiquitous, and easy to decode.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/fm.png" width="740" />

The station is coming in loud and clear, but notice we're also receiving 8 other nearby stations at the same time!
The RTL-SDR can sample the radio wave up to 3.2 million times per second.
This means it can 'see' 3.2MHz of the radio spectrum simultaneously*.
In this case the radio is tuned to 99.0MHz, but is receiving everything happening from 97.4--100.6 MHz.
Listening to these extra stations requires only changing a software parameter, not actually re-tuning the receiver like a typical radio.
If we wanted to, we could even listen to them all at once.

\* [Nyquist's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem){:target="_blank"} says the receivable bandwidth is half the sampling rate, which would suggest only 1.6Mhz of spectrum. However, SDRs perform [IQ sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-phase_and_quadrature_components){:target="_blank"} in the complex plane, effectively yielding two samples per sample.
{: .footnote}

Note we're also decoding the RDS metadata stream with song and station info.

Walkie-talkies
--------------

Lots of chatter on walkie-talkie frequencies. Unlike a typical scanner, dozens of channels can be captured simultaneously. (As an aside, most of these people sound very agitated... harried dock workers?)

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/frs.png" width="740" />

Broadcast AM
--

Capturing the AM band.
Cape Town's 3 AM stations clearly visible.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/am.png" width="740" />

The AM band is much more alive in the US, with a station visible (thought not necessarily listenable) at every 10 kHz interval.
The horizontal light blue lines are broad-spectrum interference from lightning in the area.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/amus.png" width="740" />

You can see how much the signal is swamped mid-lightning strike.
It's around this time I decided it'd be prudent to reel in my antenna and call it a night.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/am-lightning.gif" width="740" />

Digital Radio
-------------

Many broadcasts are going digital these days.
There are differing approaches in use.

### HD radio

The North American offering is HD Radio (the HD actually stands for *Hybrid Digital*, not *High-Def*).
The original analog FM broadcast is left intact, with new digital sidebands added.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/hdradio/hdradio-fft.png" /></p>

The solid bar-like appearance is typical of digital transmissions.
It means efficient use of the spectrum, though itâ€™s pretty boring to look at.

As is common with digital broadcasts, multiple content streams are provided.
Channel 1 duplicates the analog broadcast.
Channel 2 simulcasts the station's AM talk radio format.
We can see extensive digital metadata provided, and value-add services such as station logos, album art, traffic, and weather (and possibly proprietary real-time navigation data for specific GPS brands).

<p style="clear: both;" />

### DAB

<p>The European <abbr title="Digital Audio Broadcasting">DAB</abbr> standard makes a clean break with legacy FM, offering no analog counterpart and using completely different frequency ranges.</p>

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/dab.png" width="740" />

AirNav beacons
--------------

Triangulating my position using the CPT airport and Robben Island VOR airnav beacons. Listening to these beacons directly, you will hear their callsign in morse code. But they also transmit a sub-signal that can derive your current bearing to the beacon.

<!-- TODO fuzz the location -->
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/vor.png" width="740" />

A simpler NDB (non-direction beacon) that only broadcasts its callsign (BSW âˆ’â€¢â€¢â€¢ â€¢â€¢â€¢ â€¢âˆ’âˆ’)

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/ndb.png" />


Ship-tracking
-------------

Live tracking of ships in Cape Town harbor using their AIS transponders.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/ais.png" width="740" />

Plane-tracking
--------------

Live tracking of airplanes using their ADS-B transponders on 1090 Mhz.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/flights1.png" width="740" />
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/flights2.png" width="740" />

LoRa IoT and our DIY Burning Man trackers
-----------------------------------------

Decoding the location pings from our [DIY GPS trackers](http://doorinthewall.co.za/blog/lora-gps-trackers/), using LoRa internet-of-things protocol. LoRa is proprietary, but like all good things in software, some enterprising hacker has reverse-engineered it.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/lora.png" width="740" />

Cellular networks
-----------------

Sniffing serial #s of phones attempting to connect to a local cell tower over 2G.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/imsi.png" width="740" />

Weather satellites
------------------

Signal lock for NOAA 15 weather satellite passing overhead.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/noaafft.png" />

Decoded transmission from orbiting weather satellite. Visible clouds (land indistinct because pass was at night). Pretty rough, but not bad for a first try and did I mention this is a live picture of Earth directly from SPACE.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/noaa15.jpg" width="740" />

...and reference weather map of the same instant for comparison

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/weather-ref.jpg" width="740" />

More weather satellites. You may remember the very rough cut* from last post. Hereâ€™s the first decent result I got from the NOAA satellites. Taken around sunset, you can see shadows cast by clouds and land receding into night. Itâ€™s a bit hard to make out the coastline, so Cape Peninsula/False Bay circled for reference.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/noaa-sunset.png" width="740" />

setup shot?

Best result to date:

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/apt-best.png" width="740" />

This is a legacy protocol from the 60s.
New satellites no longer contain this capability, only 3 are left and one is already developing camera problems.
This might not be around for much longer.

And check out the doppler shift if we time-lapse the whole pass.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/doppler.png" />

At an orbital velocity of 7400 m/s, which is 0.0025% of the speed of light, we'd expect a doppler shift of 3400 Hz on our carrier frequency 137.1 MHz. Double that for the satellite moving towards us then away from us -- 6.8 kHz total, which [pretty closely matches](https://xkcd.com/54/) the ~6 kHZ shift we see above.

Here's a more modern transmission from the Russian Meteor M2-2 satellite.
Uses digital encoding so better quality and error correction.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/meteor_demod.png" />

The four well-defined clusters (known as a [QAM constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation#Digital_QAM)) means a clean digital signal.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew/sdr/meteor-m2-2.png" />

False color.
Red channel is thermal infrared -- you can see the [Agulhas current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agulhas_Current) peeling off the east shore of South Africa.

The image is squashed left-to-right due to the perspective of the satellite's view from low-earth orbit (think like pressing your eye against a basketball).

Literally the day after I captured this the satellite was [hit by a micrometeor](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roscosmos.ru%2F27891%2F) and will likely be retired, leaving only Meteor M2 that broadcasts this particular digital mode.
Even that one occasionally loses orientation and points sideways, returning pictures [like this](https://i.redd.it/cp3vjqrty8w01.jpg).
Space is hard.

Going beyond here for real-time Earth imagery generally requires large dishes and/or tracking mounts.
Ain't nobody got time for that.


Shortwave
---------

Aside from lots of normal broadcasts stations, which have exotic languages, and strong dash of propaganda (both religious and political), and definite mystique, shortwave is filled with lots of other interesting stuff. Shortwave travels very long distances, a bit of the wild west, many transmissions used for clandestine purposes or to probe the properties of the ionosphere.

CODAR a special kind of radar that can measure ocean waves and currents.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/codar.png">

Over-the-Horizon defense radar, likely from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus (received in Bucharest, Romania)

Radioteletype (rtty)

Olympia Radio SVO Pirgos Greece 8424 kHz

Appears to be some kind of news article in Greek transliterated to the latin alphabet.

If you listen carefully you can hear Turkish maritime station 8431 kHz bleeding though (TAH in morse code).

Time signals

Can listen to atomic clock time signals broadcast by national laboratories.
Also encode the date/time in some machine readable fashion.

USA broadcats WWV on 2.5/5/10/15/20 MHz, and encodes the date and time with a 1-bit-per-second varying pulse length low hum.

<a class="glightbox video-thumbnail" href="http://drew/sdr/wwv.mp4"><video width="740" poster="http://drew/sdr/wwv_thumb.png"><source src="http://drew/sdr/wwv.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Canada's CHU 3.33 MHz encodes things differently, using a data burst. The protocol is the absolutely ancient [Bell 103 modem](http://drew/sdr/bell103.jpg) standard.

<a class="glightbox video-thumbnail" href="http://drew/sdr/chu.mp4"><video width="740" poster="http://drew/sdr/chu_thumb.png"><source src="http://drew/sdr/chu.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

GPS has made these essentially obsolete.

These are rebroadcasts of the fundamental signal, a data-only signal WWVB at 60 kHz. Also Germany's DCF at 77.5 kHz. These are what are used by those radio-synced "atomic clocks" you can buy. Noise becomes a major problem for wideband receivers at these low frequencies and I haven't had any luck receiving them. The lowest OTA signal I've been able to receive to date was Radio Antena Satelor at 153 kHz while in Romania.

Trunked Public Safety Radio

P25

While some governments still use analog walkie-talkies*, each conversation requires a dedicated frequency channel. Most conversations are silent most of the time, wasting this limited resource. A trunking system uses virtualized 'talk groups', of which several can use the same channel simultaneously, and also employs frequency hopping to reassign talk groups as needed to maximize utilization.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew/sdr/p25.png">

<audio controls>
  <source src="http://drew/sdr/p25.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

Seems like most of what these people do is reading numbers at each other. Think I'm missing a lot of the conversation due to all the concurrent talk groups and frequency hopping (which exceeds the range that a single RTL-SDR can receive concurrently). I never played with this beyond the proof-of-concept stage. 

Europe uses a different system called TETRA

ISM bands
---------

Gate remotes

Intercepting the codes transmitted by our gate opener. The varied codes on subsequent button presses shows this is a more secure "rolling code" system.

Smart electric meter

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/smart_meter.png" width="740" />

My mom's house has a 16kW PV solar array with net metering, and you can see even immediately after sunrise it starts to make a dent in the home's power consumption. Net neutral is achieved about an hour later, then the solar panels feed excess power to the grid all the way into the late afternoon.

I know technically these numbers are visible on the outside of everyone's house, but this _kinda_ feels like the sort of thing that shouldn't be broadcasted for all to see??


Analog TV
---------

wanted to capture analog tv, but off air
but wait, cable is essentially a private broadcast antenna

[digital cable pedestal? -- if i have the right catv raw file]

digital cable though - need a vcr or converter box

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/tvsharp.png">
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/vcr.jpg" width="740">

not enough bandwidth for color/audio/fine detail.
but with rsp1a

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/ntsc-wf.png">

First hump is the main black&white signal, 2nd hump is the color information, and spike at the end is the audio channel.

decode to frames

<a class="glightbox video-thumbnail" href="http://drew/sdr/ntsc-cc.mp4"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/ntsc-cc.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/ntscinfo.png" width="740">

how faithfully can we recreate those analog artifacts? [[reference image](http://drew/sdr/colorbars_ref.png)]

(slowed down 4x -- [full speed here](http://drew/sdr/colorbars.mp4))

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/colorbars_slow.gif">

that dot crawl! ringing artifacts! that color bleed!

what can we actually do though? in theory receive scrambled channels, but those are long gone. can do next best thing, which is recreate ourselves

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/gss-waveform.png" width="740">

<a href="http://drew/sdr/scramble_orig.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/scramble_orig.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

at last, realizing the dream of 90s teenager, control over the cable scrambling

requires transmit capability

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/txsetup.jpg" width="740">

As someone who has a bit of a "thing" for connectors and adapters, this 7-degree daisy chain (USB &rarr; VGA &rarr; BNC &rarr; SMA &rarr; 20dB attenuator &rarr; Type F connector &rarr; TV coaxial) was _extreeeeemely_ satisfying.

oh and it also works on some flat panel tvs too!?

<a href="http://drew/sdr/scramble_poc_orig.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/scramble_poc_orig.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

we can have other fun like injecting our own text into the closed captioning stream

<a href="http://drew/sdr/thanks.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/thanks.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

who knew closed captions supported colors?
certainly not i.
but it was in the [spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-608), and if you send the right control sequences, it works!

and after all that, turns out analog tv still being broadcast in south africa.
i just didn't realize what i was looking at

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/pal-ota-wf.png">
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/sabc.png">

That bright line in the vertical blanking interval gave some tantalizing hope of some sort of data to decode, possibly even a [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) feed.
But alas, it's just some kind of signal quality marker.
But apparently Teletext was active in South Africa, albeit in a somewhat moribund state, [as late as 2015](https://medium.com/@carinbevan/let-me-teledata-that-for-you-9a5a19cb01c4)!?
I think I would have felt like winning the lottery if I had found an active Teletext system still running in 2019.

Digital TV
----

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/hdtv-ant.jpg" width="740" />

decent reception with the rabbit ears antenna, but not consistent enough across the full bandwidth allocation to successfully decode.
apparently sticking a [wire into a potato](https://blog.solidsignal.com/tutorials/hd-blade-vs-potato-can-spud-bring-goods/) works fairly well.

That's... a lot to unpack from just 60 seconds captured at random.
That said, the [video for _I'm Turn't_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiUdrIsqmyQ) is pretty great

SSTV from the ISS
--------

<a style="float: right; margin-left: 30px;" href="http://drew/sdr/sstv.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="300"><source src="http://drew/sdr/sstv.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

SSTV means "slow-scan television" but it's kind of a misnomer as it actually transmits still images (i.e., really slow).
ISS does this several times a year as outreach for HAM radio, usually commemorating a famous astronaut that has recently passed away.
kinda thought this was veering too much into HAM geekery for my tastes, but holy shit once that signal comes through it's pretty primal.
basically, expecting [this](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.qrz.com/x/i0jx/jxyoung.jpg), but actually [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCkbekhUdw4&t=16s)

Remote control and reverse engineering
--------------------------------------

<!-- trim and crop these videos -->

I wanted to cross over into actual radio hacking by reverse engineering an unknown protocol observed over the airwaves.
Wanted it to be manageable so simple simple with a RC remote, that also didn't overlap with established chipsets in the 433 MHz range.
I had access to one of the dog training collars proliferating on Amazon so seemed like a worthwhile target.

First gotta find the frequency.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/rc/freq.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/rc/freq.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Didn't expect it to be so low.
This turns out to be CB radio channel 19A, "reserved for remote control of devices such as model aircraft, cars, and boats"

Beware of harmonics.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/rc/harmonics_rough.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/rc/harmonics_rough.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Here's the demodulated waveform.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/rc/bfsk.png" />
<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/rc/bfsk-zoom.png" />
<!-- annotate these? -->

And fully decoded.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/rc/decode.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/rc/decode.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

With the FL2k transmitter, we can even do a replay attack.
This doesn't even require knowing how to decode the transmission.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/rc/replay.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/rc/replay.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

IR remotes
----------

Almost all remote controls communicate via pulsed infrared light, modulated between 30-56 kHz.
An IR photodiode acts as an 'antenna' that can receive this IR light.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew/sdr/irdiode.jpg" />

IR light hitting the diode produces minute amounts of electricity, akin to the voltage induced in a metal antenna from radio waves.
Although IR light is itself electromagnetic radiation (with a frequency of ~300 THz), it's best to think of it here as an alternate 'medium' through which the lower-frequency signal propgates.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/irrecv.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/irrecv.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Note the signal centered on the 38 kHz carrier frequency, by far the most common.
Also note how the IR pulses register on the camera sensor, although invisible to the human eye.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew/sdr/irdecode.png" />

Applying AM demodulation reveals the underlying data signal.

FT8 / WSPR
----------

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew/sdr/ft8-usnj.png" />

TEMPEST attacks
---------------

Reading a screen remotely via its stray radio emissions.

First step is to identify the frequency of the emissions. Need to make the monitor "sing".

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/furelise.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/furelise.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Though I prefer to sing to a different tune.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/darude.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/darude.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

So we've found the frequency; can we actually read the screen?

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/app.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/app.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

It works! It even works from across the room (and very faintly in the neighboring room).

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/across-room.mp4" class="glightbox"><video width="600" controls autoplay loop muted><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/across-room.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

It is extremely tempermental, though.
High-contrast imagery and hard transitions work best.
But even then, tiny -- almost imperceptible -- changes to the screen can completely break the effect.
How the image carries over to the eavesdropping session is not intuitive and seems to rely on internal workings of the monitor.

With perfect antenna placement and still a healthy dose of luck, I got what you see below.
Oftentimes, though, a real-world desktop barely registers as more than a smudge.

<a href="http://drew/sdr/tempest/desktop.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew/sdr/tempest/desktop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

A higher-specced SDR (at least 10 MHz bandwidth or ideally 30, vs. the RTL-SDR's 3) would work better, but hey, I'm amazed this works at all.
