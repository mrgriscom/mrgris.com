I recently bought a Software Defined Radio for... [reasons...](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19864189){:target="_blank"} and holy shit this thing has completely blown my mind.
What is a software defined radio, you ask?
Well, a traditional radio (where 'radio' is taken to mean any wireless communication device) tunes to a specific frequency and has lots of purpose-built circuits to process and interpret the signal.
A software-defined radio, on the other hand, captures the raw radio wave and sends it to a computer, which can replace all that specialized processing with software (oversimplifying a lot).
As a result, a single hardware device can replicate many different kinds of radios, or even experiment with new ones, and provide access to the signals at a level normally hidden from view.

We know these radio waves are all around us at all times, but to actually be able to *see* and play with them... it's a very strange feeling-- a kind of escaping-the-matrix, pulling back on the veils of existence experience.

Within minutes of unboxing you can listen to all kinds of radio chatter: FM radio, walkie-talkies, marine band, air band, weather band...
And while audio transmissions are cool and all, the real 🤯 stuff starts when decoding data transmissions out of thin air.
Wireless data seems so crisp and clean, but an SDR exposes all the squishy analog reality beneath.

It's incredibly addictive.
You keep chasing ever more new signals to intercept and decode.
This post is a catalog of my various SDR trophies.
And all from a [$20 USB dongle](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/){:target="_blank"} and basic rabbit ears antenna.

The delightfully minimal setup below. Most of the exploits in the post used nothing more than this:

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/setup.jpg" width="740" class="glightbox" />

Broadcast FM
--

This is the obvious first stop for testing out a radio.
These signals are strong, ubiquitous, and easy to decode.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/fm.png" width="740" />

The station is coming in loud and clear, but notice we're also receiving 8 other nearby stations at the same time!
The RTL-SDR can sample the radio wave up to 3.2 million times per second.
This means it can 'see' 3.2 MHz of the radio spectrum simultaneously*.
In this case the radio is tuned to 99.0 MHz, but is receiving everything happening from 97.4--100.6 MHz.
Listening to these extra stations requires only changing a software parameter, not actually re-tuning the receiver like a typical radio.
If we wanted to, we could even listen to them all at once.

\* [Nyquist's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem){:target="_blank"} says the receivable bandwidth is half the sampling rate, which would suggest only 1.6 MHz of spectrum. However, SDRs perform [IQ sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-phase_and_quadrature_components){:target="_blank"} in the complex plane, effectively yielding two samples per sample.
{: .footnote}

Note we're also decoding the RDS metadata stream with song and station info.

Walkie-talkies
--------------

Lots of chatter on walkie-talkie frequencies. Unlike a typical scanner, dozens of channels can be captured simultaneously. (As an aside, most of these people sound very agitated... harried dock workers?)

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/frs.png" width="740" />

Broadcast AM
--

Capturing the AM band.
Cape Town's 3 AM stations clearly visible.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/am.png" width="740" />

The AM band is much more alive in the US, with a station visible (thought not necessarily listenable) at every 10 kHz interval.
The horizontal light blue lines are broad-spectrum interference from lightning in the area.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/amus.png" width="740" />

You can see how much the signal is swamped mid-lightning strike.
It's around this time I decided it'd be prudent to reel in my antenna and call it a night.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/am-lightning.gif" width="740" />

Digital Radio
-------------

Many broadcasts are going digital these days.
There are differing approaches in use.

### HD radio

The North American offering is HD Radio (the HD actually stands for *Hybrid Digital*, not *High-Def*).
The original analog FM broadcast is left intact, with new digital sidebands added.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/hdradio/hdradio-fft.png" /></p>

The solid bar-like appearance is typical of digital transmissions.
It means efficient use of the spectrum, though it’s pretty boring to look at.

As is common with digital broadcasts, multiple content streams are provided.
Channel 1 duplicates the analog broadcast (required by the FCC).
For this station, channel 2 simulcasts their AM talk radio format.
We can see extensive digital metadata provided, and value-add services such as station logos, album art, traffic, and weather (and possibly proprietary real-time navigation data for specific GPS brands).

<p style="clear: both;" />

### DAB

<p>The European <abbr title="Digital Audio Broadcasting">DAB</abbr> standard makes a clean break with legacy FM, offering no analog counterpart and using completely different frequency ranges.</p>

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/dab.png" width="740" />

AirNav beacons
--------------

<img class="glightbox" style="float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 15px;" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/ndb.png" />

Various radio systems exist to aid in aircraft navigation.
The simplest -- an NDB (non-directional beacon) -- just endlessly broadcasts its own callsign in morse code.

To the right, we're receiving beacon BSW (![dash](/img/icon/dash.svg)![dot](/img/icon/dot.svg)![dot](/img/icon/dot.svg)![dot](/img/icon/dot.svg)&ensp;![dot](/img/icon/dot.svg)![dot](/img/icon/dot.svg)![dot](/img/icon/dot.svg)&ensp;![dot](/img/icon/dot.svg)![dash](/img/icon/dash.svg)![dash](/img/icon/dash.svg)) at 521 kHz.
You can even make out the morse code directly in the raw signal of the [waterfall plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_plot){:target="_blank"}.

<p><abbr title="VHF Omnidirectional Range">VORs</abbr> are a more sophisticated beacon, which adds a radar-like sweep to the transmission.
The timing of the sweep determines the receiver's bearing from the beacon.</p>

Below, I'm triangulating my position using the Cape Town airport (callsign CTV, 115.7 MHz) and Robben Island (callsign RIV, 117.6 MHz) VOR beacons.
A correction for magnetic declination is required as VORs are calibrated for magnetic north.

<img class="glightbox" style="clear: both;" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/vor.png" width="740" />

The error from my true position is 180m, with CTV and RIV located 19km and 15km away, respectively.
This puts me just slightly better than the expected &#xb1;0.5&deg; accuracy.

I'm impressed (and honestly a bit skeptical) the RIV beacon does so well, with no direct line of sight and Signal Hill in the way.
No opportunity to investigate further, however, as RIV has just been decommissioned!
Many VORs and NDBs are being shuttered as a casualty of GPS (though a minimum viable network will remain)... a common theme for many older signals.

Ship-tracking
-------------

Live tracking of ships in Cape Town harbor using their AIS transponders.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/ais1.png" width="740" />

I let it run overnight and by chance I captured the *SA Agulhas II* -- South Africa's Antarctic research vessel -- departing at 4AM on her once-a-year resupply voyage to [Marion Island](<%= geolink(-46.876, 37.859, 0.02) %>).

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/ais2.png" width="740" />

Tugs escorting a ship into port:

The signal from *Umbilo* seems choppy during the final manouvers-- I wonder if it's being obscured by the cargo ship itself.

Flight-tracking
--------------

Live tracking of aircraft using their ADS-B transponders on 1090 Mhz.
The Cape Town&#x2194;Joburg corridor is busy.

Aerobatics practice:

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/flights3.png" width="740" />

LoRa IoT and our DIY Burning Man trackers
-----------------------------------------

Decoding the location pings from our [DIY GPS trackers](http://doorinthewall.co.za/blog/lora-gps-trackers/), using LoRa internet-of-things protocol. LoRa is proprietary, but like all good things in software, some enterprising hacker has reverse-engineered it.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/lora.png" width="740" />

Only the bytes highlighted in red comprise our protocol.
It appears some extra headers and checksums are added by the Arduino library and/or LoRa firmware.
SDR lets us see the full data being sent 'over the wire'.

Cellular networks
-----------------

Sniffing serial #s of phones attempting to connect to a local cell tower over 2G.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/imsi.png" width="740" />

Weather satellites
------------------

<img class="glightbox" style="float: right; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/noaafft.png" />

I never gave much thought to how those satellite weather overlays made it from outer space onto [my TV](https://www.twitch.tv/retroweatherchannel), but it makes sense that before the internet they had to be beamed directly to the broadcaster and other meteorologists.

As such, there exists a fleet of satellites transmitting real-time weather info for all to see.

Here we have signal lock on one of those satellites -- NOAA 15 -- as it passes overhead...

<div style="clear: both;" ></div>

Behold the decoded downlink from an orbiting weather satellite!
The pass was at night so the land is indistinct, but you can clearly see clouds in the infrared.
Pretty rough to be honest, but not bad for a first try and did I mention this is a live picture of Earth directly from *SPACE*.

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/noaa15.jpg" width="740" />

The registration marks on the left are encouragement that we're not receiving garbage (don't be deceived -- as many are -- by the country boundaries* and lat/lon grid; those are added in post by the decoding software and are not an indicator of reliable reception).
Nonetheless, I would like some external confirmation that what I'm looking at corresponds to reality.
So I compared against a commercial satellite image found online:

\* how old is that dataset, btw? Is that the [Walvis Bay Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walvis_Bay#History)??
{: .footnote}

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/weather-ref.jpg" width="740" />

The clouds match up!

This was a serious "whoa" moment playing with this thing -- that I, a mere mortal with the most basic of antennas, could pull something tangible and useful from an orbiting spacecraft.

A subsequent attempt removes some of the rough edges.
Taken around sunset, you can see shadows cast by clouds and land receding into night.
This image shows the full frame as received, with both spectral channels included: visible light on the left and infrared on the right.
(It’s a bit hard to make out the coastline, so I've circled Cape Peninsula/False Bay in red for reference.)

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/noaa-sunset.png" width="740" />

These particular satellites lie in low-Earth orbit, thus they can only see a limited portion of the Earth at one time-- about 2--3,000km away.
Since weather is local, this limited field of view is mostly fine.

Note that these images don't really have a beginning and an end; they just kinda fade in and out.
The satellite doesn't take a photo per se, but rather livestreams the narrow swath of Earth immediately visible beneath it.
As the satellite loops around the planet in perpetuity, the result becomes a never-ending, ticker tape-like record of the Earth.

It's a bit weird to think how it just keeps sending its view even once out of range... and that it continues to do so even over the remotest parts of the world where perhaps no one is even listening.

After a few more tries, this was my best result.
The right side has been composited from both the visible and infrared channels.
I love the sun glint off the ocean!

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/apt-best.png" width="740" />

Keen eyes may notice that this image is rotated 180&deg; from the previous ones.
Africa is also tilted at a different angle.
The difference being this capture is from a descending (southbound) pass as opposed to the prior ascending passes.
Since the satellite streams its 'first-person view', the initial image as received would be flipped upside-down.

This is a legacy protocol (<abbr title="Automatic Picture Transmission">APT</abbr>) from the 1960s.
It's fully analog and has a resolution of only 4km/pixel.
New satellites no longer contain this capability; only 3 are left and one is already developing camera problems.
This might not be around for much longer.

Check out the doppler shift if we time-lapse the whole pass:

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/doppler.png" />

At an orbital velocity of 7400 m/s, which is 0.0025% of the speed of light, we'd expect a doppler shift of 3400 Hz on our carrier frequency 137.1 MHz. Double that for the satellite first moving towards then away from us -- 6.8 kHz total, which [pretty closely matches](https://xkcd.com/54/) the ~6 kHz shift we see above.

Here's a more modern transmission from the Russian Meteor M2-2 satellite.
It uses a digital encoding (<abbr title="Low-Rate Picture Transmission">LRPT</abbr>), giving better quality (6 spectral bands vs. 2, 4x improvement in resolution) and error correction.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/meteor_demod.png" /></p>

The four well-defined clusters (known as a [QAM constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation#Digital_QAM)) means a clean digital signal.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/meteor-m2-2.png" />

The image is <abbr title="meaning the red/green/blue channels don't correspond to those normal colors seen by our eyes">false color</abbr>, with red mapped to thermal infrared &ndash; you can see the warm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agulhas_Current">Agulhas current</a> peeling off the east shore of South Africa.
The image is squashed left-to-right due to the perspective of the satellite's view from low-earth orbit (think like pressing your eye against a basketball).

Literally the day after I captured this, the satellite was [hit by a micrometeor](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roscosmos.ru%2F27891%2F) and will likely be retired, leaving only Meteor M2 that broadcasts this particular digital mode.
Even that one occasionally loses orientation and points sideways, returning pictures [like this](https://i.redd.it/cp3vjqrty8w01.jpg).
Space is hard.

This is also our first exposure to the *digital cliff*, wherein digital signals tend to drop out entirely after exceeding a certain threshold of degraded signal.
Whereas analog signals just get progressively noisier in the face of increasing interference (including *any amount whatsoever*), digital signals retain perfect fidelity up to a certain point via the use of redundant bits and error correction techniques.
But once that point goes too far, the signal becomes unrecoverable.

Some [easy-to-make](https://www.google.com/search?q=qfh+antenna&sxsr&tbm=isch) [homebrew](https://www.google.com/search?q=turnstile+antenna&sxsr&tbm=isch) antennas will greatly improve the performance of these satellite modes.
Though, personally, I get a kick out of seeing how far I can get with just the basic antenna (specialized antennas are a bit too much hardware in my software defined radio).
Going further beyond here for real-time Earth imagery generally requires large dishes and/or tracking mounts.

Shortwave
---------

Shortwave is essentially *the wild west* of radio.
Popularly known as the place to receive foreign radio broadcasts, it is full of much more.
Frequencies below ~30 MHz are not limited by line-of-sight and can travel extremely long distances beyond the horizon due to the Earth's ionosphere.
An environment where countries can broadcast far outside their borders leads to some interesting finds:

{:style="margin-top: -2em;"}
- dozens of public broadcasts from far-flung destinations in exotic languages
- a strong dash of propaganda (both religious and political)
- communication for ships and planes hundreds/thousands of miles from land
- many transmissions of clandestine, military, or otherwise unknown purpose
- scientific transmissions to probe the properties of the ionosphere
- *DXing* -- seeing how far away you can hear or be heard, just for sport

Signals *may* travel very far, but results are highly volatile based on frequency, location, time of day, and solar activity ("space weather"), further adding to the mystique of the band.

Below are various shortwave oddities I have encountered.
I won't give much attention to the foreign radio programs, though they are intriguing and plentiful.
The farthest such station I was (just barely) able to tune into was (I believe) in China-- 16,000 km away! (though it's not always possible to determine the origin with certainty)

<!-- TODO explain antenna setup -->

### CODAR

A special kind of radar that can measure ocean waves and currents:

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/codar.png"></p>

### Over-the-Horizon defense radar

This extremely strong and frenetic signal is a military radar that can see beyond the horizon due to the long-distance properties of shortwave.
Its likely origin is [RAF Akrotiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Akrotiri) in Cyprus (reception occurred in Romania ~1,250 km away).

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/oth-radar.png"></p> <!-- would be cool if this were animated -->

### Ionosonde

Ionosondes are chirps that sweep across the entire band to measure conditions in the ionosphere, and in turn, real-time reception characteristics.

Like... just to underscore that wild west mentality, it's incredible that it's considered OK to do this-- interfering with literally every other user of the band on a regular basis.
You can hear the chirp momentarily trounce the tuned-in station at 0:17.

And here might be some other kind of broad-spectrum probe using a different pattern?

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/ionosonde2.png">

### Digital Radio Mondiale

Shortwave even has its own version of digital radio known as DRM.
Two content streams are provided on this station.

### Radioteletype (RTTY)

Here, SVO Olympia Radio is broadcasting a text stream out of Pyrgos, Greece on 8424 kHz.
It appears to be some kind of news article in Greek transliterated to the Latin alphabet.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rtty_svo.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rtty_svo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

(If you listen carefully you can hear the adjacent Turkish maritime station 8431 kHz bleeding though -- TAH in morse code.)

I put it through Google Translate so you don't have to:

### Time signals

Several national laboratories broadcast their official atomic clock time over shortwave due to its wide reach.
They typically speak the time aloud and also encode the date/time in a machine readable fashion.

USA broadcats WWV on 2.5/5/10/15/20 MHz; it encodes the date and time as a series of long and short pulses, 1 pulse/bit per second.
The pulses are the low humming noise (not audible with cheap speakers).

<a class="glightbox video-thumbnail" href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/wwv.mp4"><video width="740" poster="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/wwv_thumb.png"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/wwv.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Canada's CHU 3.33 MHz encodes things differently, using a data burst. The protocol is the absolutely ancient [Bell 103 modem](http://drew-x1c5/sdr/bell103.jpg) standard.

<a class="glightbox video-thumbnail" href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/chu.mp4"><video width="740" poster="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/chu_thumb.png"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/chu.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

GPS (yet again) has essentially made these obsolete.

Some countries offer their 'true' time standard at a much lower frequency, and re-broadcast them on shortwave only for convenience.
USA has WWVB at 60 kHz and Germany has DCF at 77.5 kHz, well into the longwave band.
These signals are data-only (no bandwidth for voice at these low frequencies) and are what those consumer "atomic" clocks (really radio-synced clocks) use to get the time.

My understanding is that noise becomes a major problem for wideband receivers at these low frequencies and to date I haven't had any success receiving them. The lowest over-the-air frequency I've been able to receive so far was Radio Antena Satelor at 153 kHz while in Romania.

### WEFAX

<img class="glightbox" style="float: right; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;" width="400" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/wefax/sa_best.png">

Weatherfax is a protocol for sending images, typically weather forecasts for shipping.

My results from South Africa were mixed.
There's clearly something there, but the quality is poor and there's a weird echo/ghosting that's affecting the image.
(The vertical black bars are from me hopping frequencies trying to improve reception.)

Here's what it's [supposed to look like](http://drew-x1c5/sdr/wefax/sa_ref_20191017.gif) (how quaint-- they still hand-draw the map!)

I could never counteract the strange echo and it's even quite apparent in the raw audio feed:

Turns out [it's not just me](https://goughlui.com/2019/02/16/radiofax-the-quest-for-zsj-cape-naval-south-africa-updates/)... a relief to see that my struggles with this station weren't my own shortcomings but rather more [T.I.A.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLd74Ukkbic)

Much better results from America:

While overwhelmingly used for weather, there are still a few other niche users.
At least one newspaper in Japan still broadcasts a [radiofax edition](https://archive.goughlui.com/legacy/hffax/jjc-megajapnews.jpg).

### DXing with FT8 / WSPR

Shortwave is a popular venue for ham radio, since it affords making contact with people in faraway or novel locations.
This sport is known as *DXing*.
Modern technology has refined this process into a fully automated form that removes the pesky human interaction entirely.

I jest, but by focusing on "minimum viable contact", enthusiasts have created transmission modes (such as FT8 and WSPR) that can work even with extremely weak signals.
You can rack up an astonishing number and range of contacts that would be technically and logistically impossible otherwise.

But it does sound like some sort of warbling chorus of the damned.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/ft8-live_crop.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/ft8-live_crop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Running overnight in New Jersey, I was astounded at the breadth of contacts received, including some very far away places like Saudi Arabia, Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji!

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/ft8-usnj.png" />

Running in South Africa yielded a similarly impressive spread: St. Helena, Far East Asia (Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Hokkaido), and Hawaii (nearly the opposite side of the planet).

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/ft8-zawc.png" />

I honestly expected more representation from the African continent.
But passive reception like this is really more a statement on how powerful the sender's antenna is.

### Numbers station

And finally, perhaps the creepiest denizens of shortwave: numbers stations-- broadcasts that solely read off random numbers in a robotic voice, as a means to communicate with foreign spies.

This station has been catalogued as *HM01*, operating out of Cuba. It also seems to include a data component, in an uncharacteristically modern twist for such Cold War-era tech.

Trunked Public Safety Radio
-------------

P25

While some governments still use analog walkie-talkies*, each conversation requires a dedicated frequency channel. Most conversations are silent most of the time, wasting this limited resource. A trunking system uses virtualized 'talk groups', of which several can use the same channel simultaneously, and also employs frequency hopping to reassign talk groups as needed to maximize utilization.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/p25.png">

  <source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/p25.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

Seems like most of what these people do is reading numbers at each other. Think I'm missing a lot of the conversation due to all the concurrent talk groups and frequency hopping (which exceeds the range that a single RTL-SDR can receive concurrently). I never played with this beyond the proof-of-concept stage. 

Europe uses a different system called TETRA

My mom's house has a 16kW PV solar array with net metering, and you can see even immediately after sunrise it starts to make a dent in the home's power consumption. Net neutral is achieved about an hour later, then the solar panels feed excess power to the grid all the way into the late afternoon.

I know technically these numbers are visible on the outside of everyone's house, but this _kinda_ feels like the sort of thing that shouldn't be broadcasted for all to see??

that dot crawl! ringing artifacts! that color bleed!

what can we actually do though? in theory receive scrambled channels, but those are long gone. can do next best thing, which is recreate ourselves

at last, realizing the dream of 90s teenager, control over the cable scrambling

requires transmit capability

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/txsetup.jpg" width="740">

As someone who has a bit of a "thing" for connectors and adapters, this 7-degree daisy chain (USB &rarr; VGA &rarr; BNC &rarr; SMA &rarr; 20dB attenuator &rarr; Type F connector &rarr; TV coaxial) was _extreeeeemely_ satisfying.

oh and it also works on some flat panel tvs too!?

we can have other fun like injecting our own text into the closed captioning stream

who knew closed captions supported colors?
certainly not i.
but it was in the [spec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-608), and if you send the right control sequences, it works!

and after all that, turns out analog tv still being broadcast in south africa.
i just didn't realize what i was looking at

That bright line in the vertical blanking interval gave some tantalizing hope of some sort of data to decode, possibly even a [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) feed.
But alas, it's just some kind of signal quality marker.
But apparently Teletext was active in South Africa, albeit in a somewhat moribund state, [as late as 2015](https://medium.com/@carinbevan/let-me-teledata-that-for-you-9a5a19cb01c4)!?
I think I would have felt like winning the lottery if I had found an active Teletext system still running in 2019.

Digital TV
----

<img class="glightbox" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/hdtv-ant.jpg" width="740" />

decent reception with the rabbit ears antenna, but not consistent enough across the full bandwidth allocation to successfully decode.
apparently sticking a [wire into a potato](https://blog.solidsignal.com/tutorials/hd-blade-vs-potato-can-spud-bring-goods/) works fairly well.

SSTV from the ISS
--------

<a style="float: right; margin-left: 30px;" href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/sstv.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="300"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/sstv.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

SSTV means "slow-scan television" but it's kind of a misnomer as it actually transmits still images (i.e., really slow).
ISS does this several times a year as outreach for ham radio, usually commemorating a famous astronaut that has recently passed away.
kinda thought this was veering too much into ham geekery for my tastes, but holy shit once that signal comes through it's pretty primal.
basically, expecting [this](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.qrz.com/x/i0jx/jxyoung.jpg), but actually [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCkbekhUdw4&t=16s)

Remote control and reverse engineering
--------------------------------------

<!-- trim and crop these videos -->

I wanted to cross over into actual radio hacking by reverse engineering an unknown protocol observed over the airwaves.
Wanted it to be manageable so simple simple with a RC remote, that also didn't overlap with established chipsets in the 433 MHz range.
I had access to one of the dog training collars proliferating on Amazon so seemed like a worthwhile target.

First gotta find the frequency.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/freq.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/freq.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Didn't expect it to be so low.
This turns out to be CB radio channel 19A, "reserved for remote control of devices such as model aircraft, cars, and boats"

Beware of harmonics.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/harmonics_rough.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/harmonics_rough.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Here's the demodulated waveform.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/bfsk-zoom.png" />
<!-- annotate these? -->

And fully decoded.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/decode.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/decode.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

With the FL2k transmitter, we can even do a replay attack.
This doesn't even require knowing how to decode the transmission.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/replay.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/rc/replay.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

IR remotes
----------

Almost all remote controls communicate via pulsed infrared light, modulated between 30-56 kHz.
An IR photodiode acts as an 'antenna' that can receive this IR light.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/irdiode.jpg" />

IR light hitting the diode produces minute amounts of electricity, akin to the voltage induced in a metal antenna from radio waves.
Although IR light is itself electromagnetic radiation (with a frequency of ~300 THz), it's best to think of it here as an alternate 'medium' through which the lower-frequency signal propgates.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/irrecv.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/irrecv.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Note the signal centered on the 38 kHz carrier frequency, by far the most common.
Also note how the IR pulses register on the camera sensor, although invisible to the human eye.

<img class="glightbox" width="740" src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/irdecode.png" />

Applying AM demodulation reveals the underlying data signal.

TEMPEST attacks
---------------

Reading a screen remotely via its stray radio emissions.

First step is to identify the frequency of the emissions. Need to make the monitor "sing".

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/furelise.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/furelise.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

Though I prefer to sing to a different tune.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/darude.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/darude.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

So we've found the frequency; can we actually read the screen?

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/app.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/app.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

It works! It even works from across the room (and very faintly in the neighboring room).

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/across-room.mp4" class="glightbox"><video width="600" controls autoplay loop muted><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/across-room.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

It is extremely tempermental, though.
High-contrast imagery and hard transitions work best.
But even then, tiny -- almost imperceptible -- changes to the screen can completely break the effect.
How the image carries over to the eavesdropping session is not intuitive and seems to rely on internal workings of the monitor.

With perfect antenna placement and still a healthy dose of luck, I got what you see below.
Oftentimes, though, a real-world desktop barely registers as more than a smudge.

<a href="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/desktop.mp4" class="glightbox video-thumbnail"><video width="740"><source src="http://drew-x1c5/sdr/tempest/desktop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a>

A higher-specced SDR (at least 10 MHz bandwidth or ideally 30, vs. the RTL-SDR's 3) would work better, but hey, I'm amazed this works at all.
