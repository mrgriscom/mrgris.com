title: Annoying Thought Experiments: Airplane on a Treadmill
---

argument over what happens to a plane taking off on a runway that is actually a giant treadmill, where the treadmill's speed backward is equal to the plane's speed moving forward.

the proper way of phrasing this problem is treadmill moves backward at speed equal to plane's movement forward _over the ground_.

in this case the wheels of the plane spin at twice normal speed but the plane takes off as usual. similar to case of plane taking off with a very strong tailwind (discounting any pushing force this tailwind would have on the plane)... the plane would move faster over the ground than usual (i.e., treadmill moving backward) in order to get the required speed relative to the air to generate lift to take off.

like many problems of these sorts, the restatement includes a small error/ambiguity by someone who doesn't sufficiently understand the problem, which actually changes/corrupts the problem entirely.

in this case, they state the treadmill moves backward with a speed equal to the plane's wheels _over the treadmill_. if the plane moves forward at 10mph, treadmill suddenly moves backward at 10mph, which means the wheels are spinning over the treadmill at 20mph, so the treadmill matches, and so on, until the treadmill has infinite speed.

difference between car.

this is not a meaningful problem. it makes no sense to discuss "what would happen" to a plane on an infinite speed treadmill.

to those that would argue _this is_ the actual problem. no. that's philosophical wankery.
