title: Earth Hour Is Dumb
---

miniscule actual impact on energy usage, so fail at demonstrating any ability to cut back. token gesture. like "blackle" -- yes it's a lot of energy saved, but divide by hundreds of millions of users -- waste of time to optimize 0.00001% of energy usage. savings can be swamped by non-trivial effects, such as: blackle is more annoying to use so people use it less efficiently or take more time. arguments about LCDs not benefiting are irrelevant; blackle is dumb _even if it actually decreases energy usage_.

future of energy is high-volume renewables. cutting back standard of living is not a good message. earth hour makes it look like to save the planet we all have to sit around in the dark.

takes focus off production and efficiency.
