title: "538 Problems, But a Swing State Ain't One"
---

The electoral college is defended as being purposefully designed to protect the voice of rural areas.
Without it, the argument goes, candidates would campaign only in the "few, major metropolitan areas" for an easy majority, completely disregarding the rest of the country.

This defense is complete bullshit.

While the few largest cities do indeed make up a formidable portion of the total U.S. population, it's nowhere near a majority.
And the next largest cities taper off in size quite quickly.

But yes, if you won every single vote with perfect turnout in greater

and Jacksonville,
you would indeed sweep the election.

However, even in the most die-hard city a single candidate would never win 100% of the vote.
With a still-landslide 80% of the vote, we'd have to throw in

A walk in the park, really.

It's a pretty dubious claim to begin with, that rural areas deserve more representation than urban areas.
And disconcerting how it's so often taken at face value, given how at odds it is with the basic democratic principle "one man, one vote".
There are plenty of minority constituencies that we don't carve out extra voting power for.
Why would rural areas be special?

I often wonder if the pervasiveness of this meme is subconsciously seeded by how poorly we present electoral results in map form.
Those vast, uninterrupted swaths of red...
they're so big; they must be important, population density be damned.
It's like some kind of neo-manifest destiny.

But really the only supporting argument seems to come down to "the Founding Fathers wanted it this way".
Yet, they didn't.
At the time they were busy founding, the entire country was overwhelmingly rural.
It wasn't even a concern.

History Lesson
--------------

The true origins of the electoral college are much less charitable:

1. Preserving the voice of small *states* vs. big ones.

   At the time, state identity was much stronger than national identity, and there were concerns that the largest states would look out only for themselves.
   There is even an arcane rule that an elector cannot choose both a President and Vice President from the same state as their own, lest people always vote for the 'home team'.
   Yes, that's actually in there.

   Even now it's plain to see that the smallest states (which get the biggest relative electoral boost) are a mix of rural red states (Alaska, Montana, the Dakotas, Wyoming, Idaho), and urbanized or at least coast-y blue states (Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii, Vermont, Maine, D.C.).

1. Avoiding direct democracy.

   Rather than giving the vote directly to the uninformed and gullible hordes, said hordes would vote for respected citizen electors, who would choose a qualified candidate.

   This scheme, however noble, was circumvented almost immediately.
   States have complete discretion in choosing their electors (popular vote is not even required), and states realized they could get an edge by forming a voting bloc of electors all pledged to the same candidate.
   Of course other states had to follow suit to keep their own edge, leading to our current winner-take-all system.

1. If you elect by popular vote, you don't get to vote on behalf of your slaves.

   Slaves counted as &#x2157;th's population when allocating members of congress.
   By tying the number of electors to the size of a state's delegation, you get to include your slaves in your weight on the national stage, without pesky complications like actually having to let them vote.

So the respected citizen was made moot, the slaves were freed and got the vote, and national identity is much stronger these days than state identity*.
For all these reasons (as well as just plain simplicity) I support abolishing the electoral college and instituting National Popular Vote.

\* you could argue it died when congress got the power to tax citizens directly -- if states are no longer considered separate entities when funding the government, why should they still be separate when deciding who gets to run it?
{: .footnote}

However, that could be politically untenable, and I have at least some respect for the idea that electing the President is a vote among states as well as of people, so perhaps smaller states should get a bit of a boost.

The Trouble with Swing States
------------

The electoral college itself is not the problem.
**What needs to die is the 'swing state'.**

States allocating their electoral votes winner-take-all is a disaster.
It creates a small number of very high-stakes local elections, ripe for fraud or other interference, while writing off the vast majority of the country.
For all the talk of National Popular Vote ignoring the preferences of rural voters, the current system ignores rural and urban alike, save for the lucky few that live in a state where by chance the race is close.

Should the millions of red votes in California, and every blue vote beyond 50.00001% count for absolutely nothing?
Should the votes of every safe red or blue state be treated as a foregone conclusion, the concerns of the voters behind them being completely irrelevant?

Indignation about the electoral college typically focuses on how a voter in Wyoming has 3.6x the weight of a voter in California.
But this is not an accurate reflection of the system.
We should define a vote's 'weight' as the relative impact it has on the results of the election.
With a popular vote system, each vote increments the final count by one; the impact is clear and tangible.
But in an electoral college the final 'result' is the count of electoral votes, so a vote is only worth it's potential to move that needle.
Most votes are swallowed unless they happen to be the magic one that tips how their state allocates its electoral votes.
The more 'safe' the state is, the more indistinguishable it is whether you actually voted at all.
In this sense, a voter in New Hampshire or North Carolina or Florida has hundreds to thousands of times more weight -- as in real ability to alter the tally of electoral votes -- than a voter in either Wyoming or California.

We can quantify this voter power as a function of how close the race is (how likely it will end up in the magic 50/50 scenario), the state's voting population* (how likely you are to be the one to cast the deciding vote), and the number of electoral votes you would flip.
Obviously these metrics are very sensitive to current polling and change based on which states are the most swingy, but the general principle -- and the order-of-magnitude difference between certain states -- still holds.

\* for simplicity we're not actually considering how many people in each state are eligible to vote. The proportion varies by state (from ~64--80%), which would affect the relative rankings below, but only slightly.

Disenfranchising a *single* vote in North Carolina has the same electoral impact as erasing an entire small town in California.
If that's not the antithesis of democracy, I don't know what is.

The D.C. situation is also interesting in light of their struggle to get representation in national elections.
Collectively they matter, but the district is so safe that any *individual* has an impact of literally zero.


if states were forced to allocate their electoral votes proportionally to the popular vote in their state (and they would have to be forced, due to prisoner’s dilemma), nearly all problems would be fixed.


hand-wringing over turnout

the two states that aren’t winner-take-all -- they allocate votes by winner per congressional district, with the two ‘senate’ EVs as wildcards. this is a TERRIBLE idea. it essentially brings gerrymandering into the presidency. if you going to distribute presidential say seat-by-seat, you may as well just have congress pick the president themselves.


which leads to a special point. with this proportional scheme, 3rd parties will now actually get a few EVs, which means it’s harded for one of the two major candidates to reach 50%. if they don’t, the house of representatives gets to choose. while it may have been the original intent that that would get the happen pretty frequently, now it seems like an error. so that threshold would have to be lowered, or the electors would need to get multiple rounds to build a majority coalition, like in conventions.


honestly, it would be great if we could use a preference-based system like STV or condorcet, but that is the realm of fantasy
