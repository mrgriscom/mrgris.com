I've always wondered what causes the tides, and I've always found the traditional explanations unsatisfying.

<img style="float: right;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Tide_overview.svg/400px-Tide_overview.svg.png">

This is the explanation most commonly provided:
the point on earth closest to the moon feels the moon's gravity more strongly, so the moon creates a bulge as it pulls the ocean towards itself at this point (and, uhh... on the opposite side of the planet too for some reason...).
These bulges are high tide.

But this explanation raises more questions than it answers.

* If that force is strong enough to pull the ocean up several meters, why can't I feel it manifested any other way?

* Where does all that water _come_ from?
  It seems that there's a several-meter-thick layer of water that's switching between opposite sides of the planet twice a day.
  If anything, shouldn't that create massive currents in the straits connecting the various oceans?

* Polar regions would never experience a high tide (as the angle to the sun/moon is always low against the horizon), even though they in fact have some of the highest tides.

* Why do the actual times of high tide not line up with when the moon is directly overhead? Is the delay due to the continental landmasses plowing through the bulge as the earth rotates?

Quantifying the tidal force
===========================

What kind of forces are we actually talking about here?

The tidal force is computed as $$2r\frac{GM}{R^3}$$ (which is the first-order approximation of Newton's law of gravitation $$a=\frac{GM}{R^2}$$), where:

* r: radius of object subject to tidal forces
* M: mass of object causing tidal forces
* R: distance between center of two objects
* G: universal gravitational constant

The moon (r=##6371 km##, R=##363300 km## at its closest, M=##7.348e22 kg##) yields a maximum tidal force of ##1.30e-6 m/s^2##.

The sun (r=##6371 km##, R=##147100000 km## at its closest, M=##1.989e30 kg##) yields a maximum tidal force of ##5.31e-7 m/s^2##.
(Observe that nearly a full third of the tidal forces on earth are solely due to the effect of the sun, not the moon)

So we can see that the tidal force is actually ridiculously small -- less than one-millionth the normal force of gravity (##9.81 m/s^2##).

For kicks, lets calculate the tidal force for a person standing on the surface of the earth (r=##88 cm## -- half of average human height, R=##6371 km##, M=##5.972e24 kg##). The tidal force is ##2.71e-6 m/s^2## -- greater than the combined force of the sun and moon on the earth!
Let me repeat -- **your own body feels more tidal force from the earth than the *entire earth* does from the sun and moon**.

The strength of gravity weakens with altitude, and the full tidal force on the earth at its maximum strength is gravitationally equivalent to rising up a mere ##59 cm##.
Even assuming the weak tidal force could raise the seas up to this height in the face of a rapidly rotating earth (not to mention the constantly changing positions of the moon and sun), observed tides are often much higher.

Clearly, something doesn't add up with the literal bulge explanation.

What's Really Going On
======================

The 'tidal bulge' theory is wrong, but it is actually an oversimplification of the correct depiction of tidal _forces_.

Before going any further, lets resolve the first confusion of why there's a second bulge (in tidal _force_, not actual tide itself) on the far side of the planet.
Although intuitively the moon pulls stronger on the ocean nearest to it, it is also exerting a pull on the rigid body of the earth itself, and this pull is stronger than the pull of the moon on the ocean on the far side of the planet.
The stronger pull on the close side follows our intuition -- a slight pull away from the earth towards the moon. The _weaker_ pull on the far side of the body means anything here is essentially being 'left behind' as the earth itself is being pulled more strongly towards the moon.
This manifests -- again -- as a slight pull away from the earth, now in the opposite direction.
Mystery solved.

To _really_ understand what's happening with the tides you see, you need to understand this image:

<img style="float: right;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/M2_tidal_constituent.jpg" title="mind: blown">

Ignore the colors; the important part is the white lines.

each single white line shows an area that experiences high tide simultaneously. the 'high tide' line progresses from one white line to the next, at a rate of one line per hour. the points where the lines meet experience no tidal variation at all. (this is again an oversimplification -- tides are composed of many harmonics; this image visualization the one most dominant harmonic. a no-tide point on the map may still experience tidal variation from the other smaller harmonics -- that is, each harmonic has its own no-tide points).

here is what's really going on. every point on earth is subject to a constant gravitation force from the earth itself. every point is then also subject to a much much smaller tidal force from the moon and sun. and due to the rotation of the moon, sun, and earth, the magnitude and direction of this tidal force varies constantly and in a cyclical (though very complex) fashion. imagine you have a basin of water. the water, at rest, is subject to earth's gravity. the varying tidal force is analgous to a very slight tipping or pushing of the basin. each push in isolation will create a miniscule ripple but nothing more. however, if you continue to tip/push in a cycle, eventually you will get... resonance. waves will start to build up and these waves will have complex but predictable patterns. the magnitude of the waves will be seemingly much larger than the forces we put in, according to the natural resonant frequencies of the basin. the basin shape, mimicking coastlines and ocean depths, will further affect the resultant wave pattern. tides are the water sloshing around ocean basins due to the gradual nudges of the varying tidal force!

in the bathtub as a kid i could make huge waves that spilled out of the tub, just with a gentle motion, but only if i timed it right.

standing wave phenomenon can cause 'zero movement' points (nodes)

fallout of this epiphany:

* the tides we observe are only most casually related to the tidal force itself. if the sun and moon disappearred tomorrow, the tides would continue on for quite some time (days, years, thousands of years?) until gradually dissapted by friction and turbulence. much like if you stop shaking the basin, the ripple pattern inside will persist. this also explains the complex patterns of tides observed and their seeming random offset from the actual position of the moon.

* this solves the 'where does the water come from' problem. water is not moving from one side of the earth to the other. the tides themselves are mostly localized to ocean basins. each point experiencing high tide generally has a corresponding low tide on some other part of that basin's coastline.

* observed tides may be higher (much higher) that the theoretical amount of force due to building up of wave resonances

other thoughts:

pushing our basin directly up and down is unlikely to cause any significant wave formation. it's the side-to-side forces that are important. for the same reason the point of the tidal force diagram where the force acts parallel to the horizon is most important for actually causing tides

althought the 'bulge' visualization is inaccurate for actual tides, it does describe the surface that's currently "flat" for gravitational purposes. as this surface is continually changing, surfaces that were once level become slightly sloped. this is an alternate way of visualization the 'push' (basin tipping) of the tidal force.

tidal locking is the manifestation of all the energy of the tides. the moon is already tidally locked to the earth (its rotation about its axis matches its rotation about the earth, thus the same side always faces the earth). the earth is very gradually tidally locking to the moon. tides cause the earth's rotation to gradually slow down, increasing the length of the day by 2 milliseconds per century. this is the reason we have leap seconds. since that extra energy has to go somewhere, the moon is moving farther from the earth at a rate of several centimeters per year.

Were everything to stay in this configuration forever (a scenario called [tidal locking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking)), the earth would gradually deform into this bulge (the fact that it does not fully do so in practice is also very important to the phenomenon of tidal locking, but that's beyond the scope of this post).

We wouldn't even perceive the deformation as 'tide' at all, for the most obvious reason of (a) it never changes, but more subtly (b) this deformend shape would be perceived as the new 'flat', being a surface of constant gravitational potential of the combined earth-moon-sun system, as opposed to the perfect sphere of just the earth in isolation (although the earth already is not a perfect sphere... [details, details](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid)).

the bulge is small
the bulge cannot be realized
if it were realized, we would not perceive it as anything other than normal
