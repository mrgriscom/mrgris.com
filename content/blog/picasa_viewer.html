title: Installing Picasa Photo Viewer on Ubuntu 12.04

The image viewer bundled with [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com) is unparalleled in quality.
It's fast and fluid.
It uses a full-screen lightbox for display.
It can handle absolutely huge images.
The stock image viewers in Ubuntu don't even compare.

But luckily, the Picasa image viewer runs well under [WINE](http://www.winehq.org) and can be set up on Ubuntu rather easily!

Step 1: [download Picasa](http://picasa.google.com)
---

You'll be informed Picasa is "not available for your operating system", but `View Source` on that page and you'll find the download link for the Windows version.

Step 2: install Picasa via WINE
---

    wine ~/Downloads/picasa39-setup.exe

Step 3: create a launcher script
---

    #!/bin/bash
    wine "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Picasa3\\PicasaPhotoViewer.exe" "$1" 2> /dev/null

Save this script as `/usr/local/bin/picasa-view`. (remember to make it executable)

You can now use the Picasa image viewer via command line as `picasa-view`.

Step 4: create a desktop launcher
---

    [Desktop Entry]
    Type=Application
    Name=Picasa Image Viewer
    MimeType=image/png; image/jpeg; image/tiff
    Exec=picasa-view %f
    Terminal=false
    Icon=388A_PicasaPhotoViewer.0

Place in `~/.local/share/applications/picasa-viewer.desktop`

Step 5: set as the default handler for images
---

You can do this by going to the `Properties` dialog on one file of each relevant image type and then mucking with the `Open with` tab.
But this is cumbersome, _and_ there's a bug in Ubuntu 12.04 which makes this dialog crash entirely on TIF files.

Here's an easier method: edit `~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list` to add:

    image/jpeg=picasa-viewer.desktop
    image/png=picasa-viewer.desktop
    image/tiff=picasa-viewer.desktop

under the `[Default Applications]` header.

You're done! The Picasa viewer should now be your desktop environment's default image viewer (for the above image types).

Parting thoughts
---

- Note that Picasa viewer doesn't support animated GIFs, so stick with a different viewer for those.
- Picasa viewer can browse through directories of images, but it can get confused on ordering. Run:

      touch *

  inside the image directory to fix it.
