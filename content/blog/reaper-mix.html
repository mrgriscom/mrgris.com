title: "Mixing a DJ set in Reaper"
---



I am the quintessential "press play" DJ.
I don't have the skills to mix live.
Nor would I really want to, even if I did have them.
If I've done all the work of putting together a DJ set, I want to be enjoying it when it goes on, bouncing on the dancefloor and being not-fully-sober.
I _don't_ want to be standing on the sidelines hunched over a computer, filled with the stress of doing a live performance.
So for me, the ideal is to mix and pre-record your set in advance.

Live DJ software (Rekordbox, Traktor, Serato, Mixxx, etc.) doesn't have a great way to do this.
Sure you can record your mix, but that still requires 'performing' it one shot, in realtime, with no chance to fix mistakes or make tweaks later.
I don't want to record the outputs; I want to record the inputs ("adjust this slider", "press this button", "nudge this jog wheel")... like the piano roll from a player piano.
DJ software isn't built for this.
You could probably hack up a way to capture raw MIDI events, but without any track-aware integration that can link events to rhythmic milestones vs. arbitary timestamps, you're just asking for a world of headaches.

So, what we need instead is a full <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr>.
Enter [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/).
<!-- todo link target -->

There are many DAWs, but Reaper is fantastic, shockingly affordable (and, without a license, the gentlest of nagware), runs on linux, and is friendly to both the beginner and power-user.

Another aspect I'm quite fond of is that its file format is 99% plaintext.
That means you can actually examine what changed in your project whenever you worry you accidentally screwed something up.
You can even track your project in git!

So how do we make a DJ set in Reaper?
Well... I'm a rank amaetur in both DJing and digital music production, but I want to share a workflow that was worked well for me, and has been tons of fun.

The general principle is:

- Load the songs of your playlist into separate DAW tracks
- Normalize their playback speed to all have the same BPM (i.e., beatmatch everything)
- Arrange the tracks in time for desired mix-in/out points
- Use the tracks' volume envelopes to cross-fade
- Recover your original desired BPM throughout the set via the playrate envelope on Reaper's "master" track

In reality, the full process has a few more steps:

- [Track acquisition](#track-dl)
- [Track selection and rough cut](#rough-cut)
- [_Beatmatching_](#beatmatch)
- [_Arranging_](#arranging)
- [_Transitions_](#transitions)
- [_BPM recovery_](#bpm-recovery)
- [Mastering](#mastering)

First, a caveat: a DAW is not a DJ controller; trying to replicate every bell and whistle thereof will be a cumbersome and frustrating experience.
While Reaper is very powerful, and with enough effort probably _can_ simulate anything a DJ deck can do, that doesn't mean you should.

A counter-caveat: **NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR DJ TRANSITIONS**

Most of my friends DJ using a Spotify playlist with auto-crossfade and everyone still has a great time.
Good track selection is 95% of a good mix.
Transitions are 5%, and poring over fancy transitions that you aren't even doing live honestly feels a bit cringe.
In my opinion, simpler is better (both for the end result and for your sanity), and a DAW does the 'simple' parts very very well.

What can a DAW do well vs. not?

- _stupid easy_ -- volume crossfade, BPM adjust, pitch adjust, loops, hot cues, samples
- _reasonably easy_ -- EQ
- _doable_ -- stem separation
- _diminishing returns_ -- most FX: echo out, reverb, vinyl effects (scratch, brake, backspin)

So why do this at all if you can't showboat your florid transitions?
Well, simply, beatmatching is insanely fun.
Personally I love the sound of a beatmatched transition; it keeps the energy high and feels like you're being propelled forward into the next track.

Now, into the weeds...

## Step 1: Downloading Music

MP3s are an endangered species these days, but in order to mix, you need local copies of all your audio files -- streaming services won't do.

I can't remember the last time I couldn't find a track I wanted on youtube.
With the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) command line tool, I can have that track on my hard drive in seconds.
The `-x` flag will further extract just the audio.
Be sure to install the latest version as these download bots and streaming sites are in a constant arms race.

People act like if you download off youtube, your mix will sound so ass you'll have to go into exile.
While you will likely be capped at ~128kbps quality and won't win any audiophile awards, in practice it hasn't bothered me.
Another nebulous claim is that youtube is EQ'ed/squashed for home listening on crappy laptop speakers, and it will be painfully obvious only once you're on the club sound system.
Well, it's hard to falsify that claim because I don't play on the club sound system.
But our speakers aren't exactly small and again, it hasn't affected me in practice...
There definitely are bad re-rips uploaded by gods-knows-who (a risk as old as Napster), but if you get from the official channel, I assume the quality will be sufficient, especially since youtube now runs its own music service too.

If you're still concerned, you can buy the track off [Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/).

## Step 2: Track Selection, Rough Cut

The earliest stages of making a set involves just messing around with tracks to see what sounds good with each other.
For this, I would definitely recommend still getting proficient in a live DJ program (I prefer Mixxx), and doing most of your noodling there.
It is software suited to the task, and makes a great playground for experimentation when you're still conceiving your set.

Once you have a concept of your track ordering and the transitions you'd like to make, start codifying things in Reaper.

<a name="beatmatch" />

## Step 3: Beatmatching

The Reaper beatgrid is our biggest asset.
Our goal is to align every track's beats to the beatgrid.
Once that is done, we can move tracks around at will while staying... on beat.

This is the most technical part of the process, but once you get the hang of it, it can be done quite quickly.
The procedure is thus:

- load your track into Mixxx (or equivalent) and note its BPM

(pic)

- create a new track in Reaper and insert the track (Insert > Media file)
- right-click on the content > Item properties...
  - Playback rate > Set... > Source BPM > enter the BPM from Mixxx
  - turn off 'Loop source'
  - (optionally, transpose the pitch/key via 'Pitch Adjust')
- zoom way in on the first beat of the song, align this beat to the beat grid via shift+drag (shift disables snapping to grid). Note: strongly recommend aligning beats visually via the waveform, rather than trying to do it by ear (unpredictable playback latency can make this difficult).
- now examine a beat near the end of the track and ensure it is still aligned to the beat grid
- examine 1--3 other places in the interior of the track to ensure beat alignment throughout

(vid)

If subsequent beats are not aligned:

- you might have the wrong BPM. Electronically produced music will usually have a very consistent and integer BPM
- tracks ripped from vinyl may have a non-integer BPM or a BPM that slightly varies throughout the track
- the track truly has a variable tempo/BPM, in which case you have your work cut out for you (see: xxx)

If the end of the track is off by more than a full beat, advise correcting the BPM and starting over.
Otherwise you can make fine adjustments via _stretch markers_.

- disable grid snapping (alt+S)
- place the cursor on the beat
- create a stretch marker (shift+W)
- re-enable grid snapping (alt+S)
- drag the marker to the beatgrid

(vid)

The beat should now be beatgrid-aligned, and all the beats before it scaled proportionally.
Note: the scaling happens from the beginning of the track, not the first beat, so your first beat may be moved ever so slightly off the beatgrid.
If you want to be pedantic, place as stretch marker on the first beat as well to anchor it.

(pic before/after)

Hopefully, all the track's interior beats have now fallen into place, but if not, use additional stretch markers as needed.

We now need to align the track's start to the beat grid, otherwise as soon as we move it, the start will snap to the grid and misalign the beats again.

Once your track is fully beat aligned, extend the start of the track so it starts on the beatgrid.
Extend until there's 4 bars of lead-in before the first beat.
(If extending doesn't prepend the track with silence, you forgot to disable 'Loop source')

The 4-bar buffer ensures that, combined with grid snapping, when you move the track around the timeline, it will generally stay musically aligned with other tracks.

Note: extending the track start seems to (at least on my version of Reaper) trigger an annoying bug where your beats appear to shift slightly off-grid.
As far as I can tell, this is just a artifact of rendering the waveform.
If you zoom way in, the beats are still aligned.

## Step 4: Arranging the Timeline, Mix-in/out Points

Once this is done for all tracks, you can generally drag your tracks around at will and they won't sound like a trainwreck. More likely than not, they'll even sound good.

sometimes a track sneakily extends/reduces a phrase by 1 or 2 bars, breaking the 4/8-bar symmetry thereafter

One place where a DAW really shines compared to linear mixing is how easily you can chop up and rearrange tracks.
Often there's a track with a good hook, but it drags on for too long or gets repetitive.
You can easily cut out just the parts you want.
As long as you chop on the 8-bar boundaries, you likely won't even be able to tell something is missing.
If there is a noticeable 'jump cut' from e.g., a choral effect, you can create a bit of overlap in the cut and reaper will auto-crossfade the overlapping items.
You can also repeat segments of items for looping

ripple editing as needed if making changes not at end

<a name="transitions" />

## Step 5: DJ Transitions!

Volume envelope. I like a bit of hard-cut on either end

don't be precious about it because of the mastering phase

EQ mixing
cumbersome to manage lots of envelopes. don't want to diddle with 15 different knobs.
ppl say you shouldn't clash bass, but i think it often sounds kinda nice / builds up suspense. volume frade can take care of the worst of the 'clash'
1 control point as highpass filter
wet/dry
worried about softness and suppressed low freqs that you can only hear on the main system

Echo – can set up with effects but it's involved. A short loop on rapid fade-out can be just as good

## Step 6: BPM Recovery

global playrate enable constant pitch

master track, playrate envelope to control output bpm. not a lot of resolution. 1.##x = eg 1.15 * base bpm of 120 = 138bpm
can edit directly in RPP file in text editor if need exact

instantaneous bpm changes are a bit tricky. how you handle depends on exactly what you want to achieve and how tolerant you are
instantaneous playrate change – will cause audio artifact
tempo change and bpm rebase

deep dive on bpm rate change
exponential vs linear

I went down a bit of a rabbithole after noticing that the rate the BPM is changing is set by your forward progression through the mix, which itself is set by the BPM, which is changing in response to BPM…

The playrate envelope gives the appearance of a nice constant change to BPM, but I realized there's a wrinkle.
How fast the BPM changes is linked to your speed through the track. But… as your BPM increases, you move through the track faster, which means the BPM increases faster, so you move through the track faster… seemingly giving you this runaway effect.
I wanted to characterize this.

Math!

Let us define our location within the mix as position \\(p\\), in units of beats.
Our playback speed is \\( v= \frac{dp}{dt} \\), i.e., \\( \frac{beats}{minute} \\).
We have a start BPM \\(v_0\\), a target BPM \\( (v_0 + \Delta v) \\), and an interval of beats over which to complete the transition \\(\Delta p\\).

The playrate envelope in reaper will change the BPM \\(v\\) at a fixed slope with respect to position \\(p\\): \\( v(p) = v_0 + \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta p} p \\)

To get BPM with respect to elapsed time \\(t\\) (in minutes), we must solve the differential equation \\( p'(t) = v_0 + \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta p} p \\) with initial condition \\( p(0) = 0 \\), yielding:

$$ p(t) = \frac{v_0}{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta p}} (e^{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta p} t}-1) $$

$$ v(t) = v_0 e^{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta p} t} $$

We can see there is indeed an exponential runaway term.

<!--
(Total time to complete the transition is \\( \Delta t = \tfrac{1}{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta p}} \ln(1+\frac{\Delta v}{v_0}) \\) )
-->

However, this is not how a human DJ would adjust the BPM live.
They would move the BPM slider at a steady rate in the time domain, i.e.: \\( v(t) = v_0 + \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} t \\)

This equation is not self-referential, so we can get position via simple integration: \\( p(t) = v_0 t + \tfrac{1}{2}\tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} t^2 \\)
Note we must solve for \\(\Delta t\\): given \\( p(\Delta t) = \Delta p \\), \\( \Delta t = \frac{\Delta p}{v_0 + \frac{1}{2}\Delta v} \\)

To backport this constant-via-time BPM change into the reaper envelope, we must redefine \\( v(t) \\) with respect to \\(p\\). First we must get \\( t(p) \\) from \\( p(t) \\) via the quadratic equation \\( At^2 + Bt + C = 0 \\), where \\( A = \tfrac{1}{2}\tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\), \\( B = v_0 \\), \\( C = -p \\).

$$ t(p) = \frac{-v_0 + \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}p}}{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}} $$

Substituting \\( t(p) \\) into \\( v(t) \\):

$$ \begin{aligned}
v(p) &= \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2\tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}p} \\
 &= \sqrt{v_0^2 + \frac{2v_0 \Delta v + \Delta v^2}{\Delta p} p}
\end{aligned} $$

Does this difference matter in practice?
[show graph p vs t and v vs t]
Apparently not. I'd say it's inconsequential for any sane BPM transition
surprised that the relative differences are time invariant

We tend to perceive changes as relative difference, so let's analyze how fast the BPM is changing at any moment. What does that look like?
We need to compute acceleration \\(a\\) ( \\( \frac{BPM}{minute} \\) i.e., \\( \frac{beats}{min \cdot min} \\) ) with respect to \\(v\\).

Reaper method (linear w.r.t. position): \\( a(v) = \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta p}v \\) (constant relative rate of change to BPM)

DJ method (linear w.r.t. time): \\( a = \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\) (constant absolute rate of change to BPM)

perceived change will be greater when BPM is lower

could actually argue that exponential is more “correct” perceptually

## Step 7: Mastering & Final Render

separate mixing and mastering
only do mastering at the end
jump around set to make sure you're happy with the relative levels of your different tracks
listen to your transitions and fine-tune the volume envelopes
set your master volume so you don't clip and have a modest (6db) amount of headroom
don't make the rest of your set too quiet to accommodate a particularly punchy track. consider a limiter FX (with constant gain enabled – otherwise you're just making that track louder vs. softening the peaks) on that track
render your track and ensure no excessive clipping
like to open the final rendered track and look at the waveform
