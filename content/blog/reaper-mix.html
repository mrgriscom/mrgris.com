title: "Mixing a DJ set in Reaper"
---



I am the quintessential "press play" DJ.
I don't have the skills to mix live.
Nor would I really want to, even if I did have them.
If I've done all the work of putting together a DJ set, I want to be enjoying it when it goes on, bouncing on the dancefloor and being not-fully-sober.
I _don't_ want to be standing on the sidelines hunched over a computer, filled with the stress of doing a live performance.
So for me, the ideal is to mix and pre-record your set in advance.

Live DJ software (Rekordbox, Traktor, Serato, Mixxx, etc.) doesn't have a great way to do this.
Sure you can record your mix, but that still requires 'performing' it one shot, in realtime, with no chance to fix mistakes or make tweaks later.
I don't want to record the outputs; I want to record the inputs ("adjust this slider", "press this button", "nudge this jog wheel")... like the piano roll from a player piano.
DJ software isn't built for this.
You could probably hack up a way to capture raw MIDI events, but without any track-aware integration that can link events to rhythmic milestones vs. arbitary timestamps, you're just asking for a world of headaches.

So, what we need instead is a full <abbr title="Digital Audio Workstation">DAW</abbr>.
Enter [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/).
<!-- todo link target -->

There are many DAWs, but Reaper is fantastic, shockingly affordable (and, without a license, the gentlest of nagware), runs on linux, and is friendly to both the beginner and power-user.

Another aspect I'm quite fond of is that its file format is 99% plaintext.
That means you can actually examine what changed in your project whenever you worry you accidentally screwed something up.
You can even track your project in git!

So how do we make a DJ set in reaper?
Well... I'm a rank amaetur in both DJing and digital music production, but I want to share a workflow that was worked well for me, and has been tons of fun.

The general principle is:

- Load the songs of your playlist into separate DAW tracks
- Normalize their playback speed to all have the same BPM (i.e., beatmatch everything)
- Arrange the tracks in time for desired mix-in/out points
- Use the tracks' volume envelopes to cross-fade
- Recover your original desired BPM throughout the set via the playrate envelope on Reaper's "master" track

In reality, the full process has a few more steps:

- [Track acquisition](#track-dl)
- [Track selection and rough cut](#rough-cut)
- [_Beatmatching_](#beatmatch)
- [_Arranging_](#arranging)
- [_Transitions_](#transitions)
- [_BPM recovery_](#bpm-recovery)
- [Mastering](#mastering)

First, a caveat: a DAW is not a DJ controller; trying to replicate every bell and whistle thereof will be a cumbersome and frustrating experience.
While Reaper is very powerful, and with enough effort probably _can_ simulate anything a DJ deck can do, that doesn't mean you should.

A counter-caveat: **NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR DJ TRANSITIONS**

Most of my friends DJ using a Spotify playlist with auto-crossfade and everyone still has a great time.
Good track selection is 95% of a good mix.
Transitions are 5%, and poring over fancy transitions that you aren't even doing live honestly feels a bit cringe.
In my opinion, simpler is better (both for the end result and for your sanity), and a DAW does the 'simple' parts very very well.

What can a DAW do well vs. not?

- _stupid easy_ -- volume crossfade, BPM adjust, pitch adjust, loops, hot cues, samples
- _reasonably easy_ -- EQ
- _doable_ -- stem separation
- _diminishing returns_ -- most FX: echo out, reverb, vinyl effects (scratch, brake, backspin)

So why do this at all if you can't showboat your florid transitions?
Well, simply, beatmatching is insanely fun.
Personally I love the sound of a beatmatched transition; it keeps the energy high and feels like you're being propelled forward into the next track.

Now, into the weeds...

## Step 1: Downloading Music

MP3s are an endangered species these days, but in order to mix, you need local copies of all your audio files -- streaming services won't do.

I can't remember that last time I couldn't find a track I wanted on youtube.
With the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) command line tool, I can have that track on my hard drive in seconds.
The `-x` flag will further extract just the audio.
Be sure to get the latest version as these download bots and streaming sites are in a constant arms race.

People act like if you download off youtube, your mix will sound so ass you'll have to go into exile.
It is true you'll likely be capped at ~128kbps quality and won't win any audiophile awards, but in practice it hasn't bothered me.
Another nebulous claim is that youtube is EQ'ed for home listening on crappy laptop speakers, and it will be painfully obvious only once you're on the club sound system.
Well, it's hard to falsify that claim because I don't play on the club sound system.
But our speakers aren't exactly small and again, it hasn't affected me in practice.
Now there defintely are bad re-rips uploaded by gods-knows-who (a risk as old as Napster), but if you get from the official channel, I assume the quality will be decent, especially since youtube runs its own music service now too.

If you're still concerned, you can buy the track off [Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/).

## Step 2: Rough Cut

I would definitely recommend still getting proficient in a live DJ program (I prefer Mixxx), and doing most of your noodling around there.
It is software suited to the task, and makes a great playground for experimenting during the early stages of conceiving your set.

Once you have a concept of your track ordering and the transitions you'd like to make, start codifying things in Reaper.

<a name="beatmatch" />

## Step 3: Beatmatching

Loading a track:
load your track into mixxx and note its BPM
create new track and insert your media file
item properties:
playrate -> 'set…' -> enter source BPM from mixxx
turn off 'loop source'
(note: change also pitch shift / change key here)
zoom way in on the first beat of the song, align this beat to the beat grid via shift+drag. (shift disables grid snapping)
note: strongly recommended aligning beats visually via the waveform, rather than trying to do it by ear
now examine a beat near the end of the track and ensure it is still aligned to the beat grid
if so, examine 1-3 other places elsewhere in the track to ensure beat alignment
if not:
you might have the wrong bpm. electronically produced music will usually have a very consistent and integer bpm
tracks ripped from vinyl will likely have a non-integer bpm or a bpm that slightly varies throughout the track
it is recommended to do a better job of determining the right bpm and trying again
but otherwise, use stretch markers (shift+w) to make precise and ad-hoc changes to the track's playback. insert a marker where you see the beat, and shift-drag it so it falls on the beat grid
there is a third scenario in which you track may truly have a variable bpm, in which case… you have your work cut out for you
once your track is fully beat aligned, extend the silence in front of the start of the track so that there are 4 full bars before the first beat (this is why we turned off looping). this makes it so you can drag the track around at will and grid snapping will ensure it generally meshes well with the downbeats of other tracks in the project. you almost never want to mix not on the downbeat, and musical phrasing usually dictates you want to mix at 8-bar divisions (though tempos can get sneaky and change the phrase-change point to a 4- or 2-bar offset)
note: this can trigger an annoying bug where it appears to shift your beats slightly off the beat grid. but if you zoom way in and the beat still appears aligned, i believe it is still correct, and it's just an artifact of the waveform not drawing right

## Step 4: Phrasing & Arranging for Mix-in/out

Once this is done for all tracks, you can generally drag your tracks around at will and they won't sound like a trainwreck. More likely than not, they'll even sound good.

One place where a DAW really shines compared to linear mixing is how easily you can chop up and rearrange tracks.
Often there's a track with a good hook, but it drags on for too long or gets repetitive.
You can easily cut out just the parts you want.
As long as you chop on the 8-bar boundaries, you likely won't even be able to tell something is missing.
If there is a noticeable 'jump cut' from e.g., a choral effect, you can create a bit of overlap in the cut and reaper will auto-crossfade the overlapping items.
You can also repeat segments of items for looping

## Step 5: DJ Transitions!

Volume envelope. I like a bit of hard-cut on either end

EQ mixing
cumbersome to manage lots of envelopes. don't want to diddle with 15 different knobs.
ppl say you shouldn't clash bass, but i think it often sounds kinda nice / builds up suspense. volume frade can take care of the worst of the 'clash'
1 control point as highpass filter
wet/dry
worried about softness and suppressed low freqs that you can only hear on the main system

Echo – can set up with effects but it's involved. A short loop on rapid fade-out can be just as good

## Step 6: BPM Recovery

global playrate enable constant pitch

master track, playrate envelope to control output bpm. not a lot of resolution. 1.##x = eg 1.15 * base bpm of 120 = 138bpm
can edit directly in RPP file in text editor if need exact

instantaneous bpm changes are a bit tricky. how you handle depends on exactly what you want to achieve and how tolerant you are
instantaneous playrate change – will cause audio artifact
tempo change and bpm rebase

deep dive on bpm rate change
exponential vs linear

I went down a bit of a rabbithole after noticing that the rate the BPM is changing is set by your forward progression through the mix, which itself is set by the BPM, which is changing in response to BPM…

The playrate envelope gives the appearance of a nice constant change to BPM, but I realized there's a wrinkle.
How fast the BPM changes is linked to your speed through the track. But… as your BPM increases, you move through the track faster, which means the BPM increases faster, so you move through the track faster… seemingly giving you this runaway effect.
I wanted to characterize this.

Math!

Let us define our location within the mix as position \\(p\\), in units of beats.
Our playback speed is \\( v= \frac{dp}{dt} \\), i.e., \\( \frac{beats}{minute} \\).
We have a start BPM \\(v_0\\), a target BPM \\( (v_0 + \Delta v) \\), and an interval of beats over which to complete the transition \\(\Delta p\\).

The playrate envelope in reaper will change the BPM \\(v\\) at a fixed slope with respect to position \\(p\\): \\( v(p) = v_0 + \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta p} p \\)

To get BPM with respect to elapsed time \\(t\\) (in minutes), we must solve the differential equation \\( p'(t) = v_0 + \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta p} p \\) with initial condition \\( p(0) = 0 \\), yielding:

$$ p(t) = \frac{v_0}{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta p}} (e^{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta p} t}-1) $$

$$ v(t) = v_0 e^{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta p} t} $$

We can see there is indeed an exponential runaway term.

<!--
(Total time to complete the transition is \\( \Delta t = \tfrac{1}{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta p}} \ln(1+\frac{\Delta v}{v_0}) \\) )
-->

However, this is not how a human DJ would adjust the BPM live.
They would move the BPM slider at a steady rate in the time domain, i.e.: \\( v(t) = v_0 + \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} t \\)

This equation is not self-referential, so we can get position via simple integration: \\( p(t) = v_0 t + \tfrac{1}{2}\tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} t^2 \\)
Note we must solve for \\(\Delta t\\): given \\( p(\Delta t) = \Delta p \\), \\( \Delta t = \frac{\Delta p}{v_0 + \frac{1}{2}\Delta v} \\)

To backport this constant-via-time BPM change into the reaper envelope, we must redefine \\( v(t) \\) with respect to \\(p\\). First we must get \\( t(p) \\) from \\( p(t) \\) via the quadratic equation \\( At^2 + Bt + C = 0 \\), where \\( A = \tfrac{1}{2}\tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\), \\( B = v_0 \\), \\( C = -p \\).

$$ t(p) = \frac{-v_0 + \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}p}}{\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}} $$

Substituting \\( t(p) \\) into \\( v(t) \\):

$$ \begin{aligned}
v(p) &= \sqrt{v_0^2 + 2\tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}p} \\
 &= \sqrt{v_0^2 + \frac{2v_0 \Delta v + \Delta v^2}{\Delta p} p}
\end{aligned} $$

Does this difference matter in practice?
[show graph p vs t and v vs t]
Apparently not. I'd say it's inconsequential for any sane BPM transition
surprised that the relative differences are time invariant

We tend to perceive changes as relative difference, so let's analyze how fast the BPM is changing at any moment. What does that look like?
We need to compute acceleration \\(a\\) ( \\( \frac{BPM}{minute} \\) i.e., \\( \frac{beats}{min \cdot min} \\) ) with respect to \\(v\\).

Reaper method (linear w.r.t. position): \\( a(v) = \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta p}v \\) (constant relative rate of change to BPM)

DJ method (linear w.r.t. time): \\( a = \tfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\) (constant absolute rate of change to BPM)

perceived change will be greater when BPM is lower

could actually argue that exponential is more “correct” perceptually

## Step 7: Mastering & Final Render

separate mixing and mastering
only do mastering at the end
jump around set to make sure you're happy with the relative levels of your different tracks
listen to your transitions and fine-tune the volume envelopes
set your master volume so you don't clip and have a modest (6db) amount of headroom
don't make the rest of your set too quiet to accommodate a particularly punchy track. consider a limiter FX (with constant gain enabled – otherwise you're just making that track louder vs. softening the peaks) on that track
render your track and ensure no excessive clipping
like to open the final rendered track and look at the waveform
