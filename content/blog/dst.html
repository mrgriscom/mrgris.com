title: You May Not Like DST, But You Most Certainly Like Whining

Every time the clocks change there's another flurry of articles and blog posts bemoaning Daylight Saving Time.
Many decry that DST is pointless.
Others whine that the switch is too complicated or burdensome.
A rare few just [completely lose their minds](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/daylight-saving-time-is-terrible-heres-a-simple-plan-to-fix-it/281075/) instead.

But let's set the record straight.
DST is unequivocally awesome.
It's awesome because it makes the sun set later, and the sun setting early is fucking depressing.
Now I'll admit I'm a night owl, so to some extent this is just personal preference.
But I also note that time zone boundaries have gradually drifted westward over time, as cities and counties on the edge realized they could make the sun set an hour later simply by switching sides.
This lends some credence to a later sunset having broad appeal.

It's _not_ about energy savings or making life easier for farmers or any of that.
Even if there ever were any appreciable difference back in those simpler times, these days it's no bigger than the margin of error.
It's about lighter evenings and that the summer sun rising two hours before anyone is awake is dumb.
Full stop.

As for the actual twice-a-year _switching_ between Daylight and Standard time, I could take it or leave it.
If it were up to me, DST would last all year long.
Several countries (most recently Russia) have decided to do this, setting their "standard" time to one (or more) hours ahead of solar time -- effectively DST year-round.
Conventional wisdom in the US says that to do the same would be politically infeasible over safety concerns about schoolchildren catching their busses in the dark -- a justifaction likely to be just as statistically insignificant as any claim about DST vs. Standard Time -- but it's _for the children_, so...

Not to say I've ever had much trouble with the switch itself.
You have to change the time on your clocks, but my most important clocks (computer, phone) are smart enough to switch themselves.
Changing my wristwatch and car take about ten seconds each.

Then there's the complaint of grogginess for the next few days afterward.
Jesus christ people; I regularly fly with time differences in excess of three hours and it takes me about a day or two to recover.
To complain about a difference of _one hour_ which occurs _while you sleep in your own bed_ is THE literal first-world problem!

The most valid complaint is that of forgetting the time change entirely, and ending up late for something.
There's a reason the change happens early Sunday morning.
Even if you manage to miss the week's work of warnings, and go an entire day ignorant of the true time, worst case scenario is you might indeed miss one meeting.
The one time I almost got bit was a flight leaving the Sunday of the change.
Even then I still made it.

Though I hope I've convinced you DST is a Good Thing&trade;, the _real_ point of this post is to rail against the two most rage-inducing retorts in any thread about DST:

"Just get up earlier"
---------------------

Maybe this would work if you lived in a cabin in the mountains (I did briefly experiment with DST -- _Drew Standard Time_ -- for a week at an off-the-grid beach bungalow in Mozambique).
But normal people live their schedules according to external commitments -- regular hours for work, school, shopping, restaurants, <s title="I guess it would actually work in your favor on this one!">last call</s>.
Either you're an outsider to the daily life of everyone around you, or you try to convince a critical mass to switch with you in some kind of 'war of the clocks', creating the very problem DST is meant to solve.

Funny, these people never respond well to the suggestion, "hey, how about those sitting-duck schoolchildren get up an hour _later_..."

I'm a programmer, and I read programming forums, so I must presume its other programmers spouting this idiocy.
But here's a question any decent programmer should be able to answer: when you want to change something, is it easier to change it in one place, or in a million places?

"Abolish time zones and everyone use UTC"
-----------------------------------------


this is what i call a "consider getting some chickens" moment (from some cracked-style article about "10 easy frugal living tips", of which one was "consider getting some chickens") -- a statement so inane and completely divorced from any practical utility that it makes you immediately question everything that person has said or every will say.

or to paraphase the good charles baggage "i cannot rightly comprehend the confusion of thought that would yield such a proposal"

to anyone who even *thinks* this, what the fuck is wrong with you.

i'm sure people would love having the date change in the middle of the day
it'd be awesome to travel to a new place and completely have to calibrate when is the proper time to eat/sleep/do normal daily activities
i'm sure the world population would eagerly embrace completely divorcing the notion of time from the position of the sun -- a universal and key aspect of the entire human existence -- all for the convenience of scheduling conference calls across time zones and being lazy about your date formatting code.

cmon programmers... optimizing for not even the 1% at the expense of the 99%, more like the 0.0001%

"but most people are so obsessively concerned with their
  immediate personal needs that anything that could be beneficial on a
  much larger scale have no chance of surviving"

"the focal point is that the masses, those
  who exert no effort to better themselves, cannot be expected to help
  solve any problems larger than their own"

polar communities / western china will reject 'official' timezones when they differ from what the sun dictates even by an hour or two.
