every time dst switches there's always a bunch of whining

complain the dst is 'pointless' or 'complicated'

dst is in fact awesome
i could take or leave the actual time change, but having the clock ahead of solar time is great. the sun setting early is depressing. i would stay on dst all year round if possible (as russia recently decided to do). now i'm generally a night owl, so it could be my personal preference. however, historically (in the us at least), the timezone boundaries have gradually crept eastward as jurisdictions realize they can make the sun set an hour later just by switching sides of the line. so i think that shows there is at least some popular support for the idea.

although the original motivations are largely bullshit (energy savings, etc.), it does make sense that it's dumb to have the sun rise at 4:30am in the summer, hence "wasting" the daylight that could be "saved".

and personally, i've never had much trouble with the switch itself. my computers and phone do it automatically. so what if you're late for one meeting. really the only close call i've ever had was then taking a plane the day after the change.

then the stupid suggestions come out:

'just get up earlier'

i'm a programmer, so i read programming forums, so i must presume its other programmers spouting this idiocy. maybe that would work if you lived in a cabin in the mountains (i did briefly experiment with 'drew standard time' for a week at an off-the-grid beach bungalow in mozambique), but normal people live their schedules according to external commitments -- regular work hours/school hours/eating hours and closing times for restaurants/bars/last call. here's a question any decent programmer should be able to answer -- when you want to change something, is it easier to change it in one place, or a million places?

'abolish time zones and everyone just use UTC'

this is what i call a "consider getting some chickens" moment (from some cracked-style article about "10 easy frugal living tips", of which one was "consider getting some chickens") -- a statement so inane and completely divorced from any practical utility that it makes you immediately question everything that person has said or every will say.

or to paraphase the good charles baggage "i cannot rightly comprehend the confusion of thought that would yield such a proposal"

to anyone who even *thinks* this, what the fuck is wrong with you.

i'm sure people would love having the date change in the middle of the day
it'd be awesome to travel to a new place and completely have to calibrate when is the proper time to eat/sleep/do normal daily activities
i'm sure the world population would eagerly embrace completely divorcing the notion of time from the position of the sun -- a universal and key aspect of the entire human existence -- all for the convenience of scheduling conference calls across time zones and being lazy about your date formatting code.

cmon programmers... optimizing for not even the 1% at the expense of the 99%, more like the 0.0001%

"but most people are so obsessively concerned with their
  immediate personal needs that anything that could be beneficial on a
  much larger scale have no chance of surviving"

"the focal point is that the masses, those
  who exert no effort to better themselves, cannot be expected to help
  solve any problems larger than their own"

polar communities / western china will reject 'official' timezones when they differ from what the sun dictates even by an hour or two.
