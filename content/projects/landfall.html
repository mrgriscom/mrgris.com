<p>
If you've ever stood on a beach staring out at the ocean, wondering what's across the other side, this project is for you.
It computes the first landfall in all directions from a given point.
Results are presented in a panorama-esque 'first person' view, as well as more traditional sightlines viewable in Google Earth.
Due to the curvature of the Earth, the results may surprise you!
Powered by data from OpenStreetMap.

<p>
Whenever I've stood on a beach, staring at the expanse of ocean in front of me, my mind inevitably wanders to what's across the other side.
After a journey of thousands of miles across featureless water, where would you end up?
What foreign shore would you make landfall?
</p>

<p>
I've seen a few treatments of this concept, but to date none have been fully unsatisfying.
By far, the biggest mistake is taking 'across' to mean a <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/OMHsSEb.png">straight bearing east or west</a>, completely ignorant of the curvature of the Earth.
Most people, when looking out from the US East Coast, think they're "looking at" Europe, when in fact the direction of Europe is much farther northeast, and mostly blocked by Canada; you're actually looking at Africa.
That is to say: starting due east from America, a straight line along the curved surface of the Earth will hit Africa.
Nevermind that most of the US East Coast faces rather south of east anyway&hellip;
</p>

<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/8jIsbL2.png">Other attempts</a> do a better job, but even then feel somewhat lacking.
Islands and archipelagos are overlooked, even though they may completely blot out the paths to farther continents.
I want to see every scrap of rock that I may run aground on.
And having a sense of relative distance would be nice, too.
</p>

<p>
At lastly, to my knowledge, every previous attempt has been created manually by hand.
</p>

<p>
Thus I created <em>Landfall</em>.  
</p>

<h3>Computing landfall</h3>

<p>
  Step 1 is to compute the landfall from a given point in all directions.
  This is achieved through an algorithm that determines the distance to land at many evenly spaced bearings.
  With enough samples (default settings compute about 50 samples per degree) you can get a smooth coastline curve of the land across the ocean from you.
  The algorithm is designed such that small rocks or islets are never 'missed', even if they are narrower than the spacing of samples.
</p>
  
<p>
  The determination of distance to land along a given bearing factors in the curvature of the (assumed spherical) Earth, as well as oddities like crossing beyond the antipode (more than halfway around the world) before hitting land.
  In addition to distance, the country/state of the land hit is also noted.
</p>

<p>
  Through the use of spatial indexing, a single landfall 'viewshed' can be computed in under 30 seconds.
</p>

<h3>Source data</h3>

<p>
  The source data for both coastline and political boundaries is extracted from OpenStreetMap.
  The coastline extract can basically be used as-is (with a few corrections that get automatically applied).
  The political data was much messier (failing to include outlying islands, not exactly lining up with adjacent countries, etc.), so has been curated into a cleaned dataset that lives with the project.
</p>

<p>
  One interesting side-effect of this project was exposing many phantom islands in OpenStreetMap that don't actually exist.
  Much of OSM's coastline data comes from automated extraction from satellite imagery, which obviously will make some mistakes.
  On the normal map such scraps of land are nearly imperceptible, but in a landfall perspective they jump out like night and day.
  (I have since made edits to remove these false islands.)
</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>
  Now that we have the raw data, how to visualize it?
  Raw export to a map is illuminating, but makes it hard to appreciate direction from source point (due to curvature), as well as mixing of the very near and very far.
</p>

presentation:
data can be exported to kml to see the sightlines on a normal map (conventional view)

first-person view
join the very near and very far

<p style="font-size: 80%;">
canyon-like presentation
simulates the view of actually standing at a point and looking out upon a vista
farther land becomes smaller and recedes into the distance
try to view it not like a bar chart but rather a scene in '3d'
try to perceive the depth
both near and far
creases
(labeling is manual)
