<h1>Day 1: Saturday June 6</h1>

<p>The world's largest (non-stylized) globe, and the largest rotating globe of any kind. The scale is 1:1,000,000, making it about 41ft across, and 1 inch &#x2248; 16 miles. DeLorme headquarters, Yarmouth, ME.</p>

<p>
Cruising for open wifi in Charlottetown<span class="abbie"> (and looking like a cyborg).</span> Ch-town was pretty unphotogenic otherwise<span class="abbie"> (Or rather the first of many examples of our inability to photograph cities).</span> We did almost get pressed into service on a Canadian jury, but no photos of that.<br>

<p>The Cabot Trail was stunning, but we were in a rush so took very few pictures of the scenery</p>

<p>
First ferry! (a short 5-minute hop that was so small we didn't even notice it on our map until too late)<br>

<img src="/img/x/labrador/day06/sm2623.jpg"></p>

<p>We drove through the night to reach Fortune, NL, the departure point of our next ferry for the following day. Only about 160 mi as the crow flies, we drove 590 miles to get there. Newfoundland does not give you much choice of routes.</p>

<p>We were worried about even being able to make it in one stretch<span class="abbie">  (and spazzing about potential moose altercations)</span>. All gas stations seemed to close by 11pm at the latest. Even filling up when we could, it was still too far to make it on one tank. Along the entire route, a single all-night station in Gander saved us.</p>

<p>The rest of the drive went smoothly, aside for getting pulled over at 4am (I had not seen a single police car in Canada till this point). He politely informed me of the speed limit, bid me a good day, and walked off.</p>

<p>We pulled into our destination at 5:30am, in broad daylight, to what seemed to be a ghost town. We promptly crashed (as in, 'fell asleep') in a parking lot; figuring out just where the hell we were and how to get on our ferry could wait a few hours</p> 

<h1>Day 7: Friday June 12</h1>

<p>Today we voyaged to the French overseas territory of St. Pierre and Miquelon, the last vestige of colonial-era 'New France'. It is not part of Canada, but sovereign French territory; they use the euro, electricity is 220V, and you have to clear customs on each side. This also means... country #38 for Drew! (#25 for Abbie<span class="abbie"> fail?</span>)</p>

<p>

<img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2627.jpg"></p>

<p>
A little too much to brave. Shortly after this they said 'everybody go back down below so we can go back to full speed'.<br>
<img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2628.jpg"></p>

<p>
The ride was <i>very</i> rough. The windows on the entire left side of the ship were as if we were in a carwash.<br>
<img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2629.jpg"></p>

<p>
Vive la France!<br>
<img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2631.jpg"></p>

<p>And how French it was...</p>

<p><img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2642.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2635.jpg"></p>

<p>Have no fear; there were Peugeots and Citro&#xeb;ns aplenty as well.</p>

<p><img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2649.jpg"></p>

<p>The tourist info lady snootily informed us: 'the people of St. Pierre like to eat out on the weekend; you must have a reservation [at one of the island's five only restaurants]'. We opted for the most casual and earliest-opening place there was. It was very popular among St. Pierre teenagers. I presume the tourist office lady stifled her laughter when I asked whether we needed to make a reservation there. (Note all boys at one table, all girls at the other)<br>
<img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2654.jpg"></p>

<p>Restaurants opened late, and in the lull beforehand, the streets were empty except for what few tourists there were on the island all out wandering confused and hungry.</p>

<p>
Mmmmm, cr&#xea;pe... (this was about 9:20pm, btw)<br>
<span class="abbie">Nothing wrong with tipsily eating crepes at 9:20! (Drew just ate two of them)<br></span>
<img src="/img/x/labrador/day07/sm2657.jpg"></p>

<h1>Day 8: Saturday June 13</h1>

<p>A lazy day around St. Pierre. We rented some extremely shitty bikes and toured the (small) island. We ran out of water quickly, so I snuck into the yard or a house that looked empty and re-filled with their hose. A moment later, the owner drove up in a van emblazioned 'St. Pierre Department of Water Assessment and Quality' (only in French, of course). Is that irony?

<h1>Day 9: Sunday June 14</h1>

<p>More St. Pierre. A beautiful day. In addition to the island just being surreal by itself, it was surreal how much more easily we got back to Newfoundland than getting to St. Pierre. Not only was the ride perfectly smooth, but we had a different ferry -- a modern high-speed catamaran with all the latest accoutrements.</p>
